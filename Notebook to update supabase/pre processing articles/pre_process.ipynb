       "'It was a quiet week for Frax with nothing major externally to drive the narrative in either direction. If you’ve been watching Frax Check, you would know that the fundamentals have been improving and the community is getting excited for the upcoming Shanghai upgrade. In this week’s review, we’re covering governance on governance on governance.  DeFi Dave’s brainchild passed with flying colors this week and will start a new era of incentivized Frax based educational content. If you are interested in making content, below is the reward structure and we will be coming out with further instructions next week (stay tuned!) In what has turned into a questionable outcome, the DAO has voted against unlocking sdETH LPs. The issue is contentious because almost all the liquidity for the pair is locked for 2-3 years.  The main issue though is that LPs should have known the risks of locking. So while Frax has kept their side of the bargain to maintain the peg and provide FXS rewards, its StakeDAO’s fault for discontinuing the product. No money is at risk and the pool is still earning a 3.5% yield in FXS. So if they want to unlock, a rage tax will likely have to be added.  (Twitter has deactivated Twitter embedding… I’ve posted the links here. Hopefully it’s fixed in the next week or so.)'"
