0,"It was a quiet week for Frax with nothing major externally to drive the narrative in either direction. If you’ve been watching Frax Check, you would know that the fundamentals have been improving and the community is getting excited for the upcoming Shanghai upgrade. In this week’s review, we’re covering governance on governance on governance.  DeFi Dave’s brainchild passed with flying colors this week and will start a new era of incentivized Frax based educational content. If you are interested in making content, below is the reward structure and we will be coming out with further instructions next week (stay tuned!) In what has turned into a questionable outcome, the DAO has voted against unlocking sdETH LPs. The issue is contentious because almost all the liquidity for the pair is locked for 2-3 years.  The main issue though is that LPs should have known the risks of locking. So while Frax has kept their side of the bargain to maintain the peg and provide FXS rewards, its StakeDAO’s fault for discontinuing the product. No money is at risk and the pool is still earning a 3.5% yield in FXS. So if they want to unlock, a rage tax will likely have to be added.

1,"This week, we snagged an interview with Manifold Finance after they announced the upcoming launch of mevETH. Head of BD James sat broke down their new LSD primitive and how it’s different from the rest. We’re excited to see how Manifold blends in their existing tech stack to find higher yields for stakers. Manifold Finance is middleware infrastructure that functions as an intermediary between Ethereum users and validators. Manifold’s goal is to own the entire infra stack for collecting, relaying and executing transactions to deliver the highest return on investment (ROI), thus aiding the creation of Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) by functioning as an efficient block builder. They are a key part of the Ethereum network operations, as they sort transactions typically with the goal of building blocks with the highest MEV. Advanced on-chain actors known as ""searchers"" have devised a method to exploit your transactions at your expense, known as Maximal Extractable Value or MEV. This practice involves ""frontrunning"" and ""backrunning,"" where the searcher puts in an order before you and then profits from any price slippage caused by your trade. Together, both these practices are referred to as a ""sandwich attack"" and can lead to a considerable loss of funds, running into thousands or even millions of dollars. Currently, Manifold processes transactions through its products OpenMEV and SecureRPC. The former protects users from MEV attacks and takes advantage of MEV opportunities to return funds to users. The latter is open infrastructure for transaction routing and execution. The missing piece so far has been the validation stage. While Manifold is able to relay and route transactions, block building was left to other services. The addition of mevETH will allow Manifold to own their entire infra stack and use their middleware technology to maximize return across all transactions. By using SecureRPC, your transaction is sent to Manifold who builds the highest value block, by discovering which searchers will bid the highest to execute backruns. Manifold runs a MEV market that finds the most optimal and a rebate is paid to the user. We think so. But it’s too early to tell and we will have to wait for mevETH’s launch.  Manifold Finance website Twitter James’ Twitter Gm Gm, Really loving this piece and the work you do here. I also run a web3 news substack for underrepresented creators called Facesofweb3. Would you be open to a recommendation exchange? Our subscribers need to be able to find each other! Great job, once again!",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/manifold-finance-meveth-interview
2,"Check out the full interview for all of Surfer’s insights. Like many, DeFi Surfer originally was a Bitcoin Maxi when he first got into crypto. Yet as time went on, he became more interested in Ethereum due to the fact that applications could be built on top of it. Reflecting on his journey, he was open about the hurdles of interacting with the world on-chain whether it was self-custody or being comfortable confirming transactions on Metamask.   It is because of these obstacles that he thinks their will be a huge opportunity for exchanges like Binance and Coinbase are best suited to abstract away the complexities of these decentralized systems for their customers. In his words “Coinbase could be the freeway into Web 3.” Already, these organizations have launched their own chains (BNB, Base) and through its resources could leverage their positions as on/off ramps into crypto to funnel users there.  With the recent Arbitrum airdrop having taken place, it brought a lot of attention again to L2s. Yet, what has differentiated Arbitrum from its peers is how they have done a phenomenal job organically attracting a a builder-first community which has in turn made it one of the hubs of innovation within DeFi. GMX has been Arbitrum’s killer app who’s primitives such as GLP have been the most popular to build on top of. By creating a flywheel of attracting apps that people want to use, users and liquidity becomes stickier and stickier. Even as the bear market has dropped TVLs by a large margin, Arbitrum has been one of the few L2s/alt-L1s that has legitimate adoption. The entire collapse of Silvergate was “frustrating” for DeFiSurfer, as they were providing a number of services for crypto companies. He believes that the primary cause of their downfall was their close relationship with none other than FTX who’s collapse sent shockwaves throughout the industry. When the exchange went under, it “spooked” their deposit base and sent them running to other institutions. Silvergate went from 14bn in deposits to 0 in the course of 5 months. It’s a crazy “fear-driven situation” that was originally sparked by the malfeasance of SBF. Furthermore, rising interest rates are likely to have pushed many to seek new opportunities outside of Silvergate. Towards the end of the interview Surfer’s brought up his main concern with Frax…. how could they maintain an operation at its current scale with its core team in the single digits? Compared to Coinbase or Binance which collectively employee thousands of people, it makes an outsider wonder how competiting with them would be feasible unless the Frax DAO boasted similar numbers? Well, the answer is simple, the smart contract handles most of the work and one elite DeFi dev is worth a priceless amount compared 10 average devs.  Surfer may have a point though that Frax does need more builders not on the core team but contributing in the ecosystem. Hackathons and other incentive programs could be the answer to motivate builders to build on Frax and integrate them into their projects. Not financial or tax advice.

3,"FraxBP at $492M TVL and 113% Of 3Pool — holding above 4 weeks frxETH at 128,274 ETH at 2% WoW Growth — slowest growth so far Profitability for April is $530k — aggregated revenue across AMO As always, we have our flagship stablecoin: $FRAX.  Though there aren’t much news on this front.  The supply has remained flat at $1.045B and the peg ranged from $0.991 to $1.001.  The lower end of the range is concerning but we believe we’re still recovering from the USDC fiasco.  In the markets, we swapped 100M FRAX for USDC and received an exchange rate of 0.9988 — pretty much unchanged from last week’s. There were slight movements on the Collateralization % and Decentralization %.  A minor 50 bps increase in the Collat % and a 3.5% drop in the Decent %.   We’re hoping for the collateralization % to rise to 100% and for the decentralization to increase as well. The FraxBP has a TVL of $491M — the ratio is reverting back to 60/40.  This also means that the exchange rate isn’t the best like it was a few weeks ago.  We have a 221M monthly volume which is a 43% utilization rate.   Fortunately, we are maintaining our stronghold above the 3pool.  We’re currently 113% of the 3Pool.  We were able to hold onto our grounds for the past four weeks.  Additionally, we have the breakdown of each of the pools here.  The TVLs are $493M for FraxBP, $436M for 3Pool, and $384M for Frax3CRV.   frxETH experienced the slowest week-over-week growth at 2% this week.  It currently has 128k ETH and Shanghai is right around the corner.  We’re seeing the split between the sfrxETH and the Curve LP hovering around 2/3 and 1/3, respectively. frxETH is still a stablecoin so we must check the peg.  On the dashboard, it shows 0.9993 but we mustn’t trust a dashboard so we’ll go to the markets.  We conducted a 3.5k frxETH swap for ETH and received an exchange rate of 0.9977.  We want to see the numbers ending in 85 and above.  When looking at the competitive landscape, there’s Lido at the front of the pack with nearly 75% of the market.  Frax is currently fourth on the list with a market share of 1.62% but it has the highest 30-day change of 17.7%.  Though in the yield department, frxETH is at the top of the list with 5.64% versus the closest competitor Stakewise at 4.54%.  Not much changed on the FPI front.  The supply, cap, and treasury TVL all stayed pretty much the same.   But the equity value increased by $200k so the veFPIS holders are happy. The Fraxlend product has been slowly recovering since the USDC depeg but things are nowhere near the level it was.  The collateral value and the supply value is still grinding to get to where it once was.  The utilization rate is also down to 64%.  We want to see this in the high 70s or low 80s.   There’s $70M in TVL for Fraxswap but the impressive part is the volume that it facilitates.  There were $168M volume in March and the top volume pool the past 7 days is the FXS/FRAX pool with nearly $20M.   There was also a quiet week on the AMO front.  We saw an increase of 70 bps.  The Curve AMO increased by $2M, Liquidity increased by nearly $7M (the largest bump), and the Investor AMO increased by $2M as well.  Here we aggregated all the revenue across the AMOs and FPI.  We have $530k in losses from Convex — granted we just paid the bribes and yet to reap the rewards.  We received $14k from the FraxLend AMO from supplying FRAX and we did not receive any fees from liquidation in April so far.  On the FPI front, there’s currently a “loss” of $13.9k but there are over $50k of unclaimed rewards so once those rewards are claimed we can update the figures here. That’s it for this week of Frax Check!  Thanks for reading and see you guys next week.  Not financial or tax advice.

4,"Frax Finance was initially a hybrid algorithmic stablecoin protocol that proved itself over several years of operation, but it came into the spotlight at the beginning of 2023 with its Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) product frxETH. With the LSD narrative running rampant, Frax benefited as one of the clear winners due to its innovative two-token system. What frxETH illustrates is how Frax is ultimately a stablecoin protocol with the goals of increasing the monetary premium of its family of stablecoins (FRAX, frxETH, FPI). These stablecoins would be aided in adoption by Frax’s “holy trinity” of DeFi primitives such as Fraxswap and Fraxlend. Most recently, Frax voted to have its flagship stablecoin 100% collateralized, marking the end of an era of partial-collateralization. FRAX’s backing is primarily made up of its AMOs which put its idle USDC collateral to work. Currently, the largest AMO operating today is the Curve AMO which has hundreds of million of dollars in TVL. While the collateral ratio of FXS backing is determined by market forces, Frax’s AMO adjusts supply of FRAX to maintain price stability. This is akin to a central bank conducting open monetary operations for their economy. Frax uses a two-token model, frxETH and sfrxETH, to provide a unique LSD offering. frxETH acts as a stablecoin pegged to ETH and does not earn any yield, whereas sfrxETH receives all yield from staking. Frax’s governance token FXS uses Curve’s ve token lockup model, dubbed veFXS. Currently, 41.22% of the supply is locked up. Like Curve, FXS gauges can be bribed. However, current bribe amounts are negligible. veFXS holders are entitled to 100% of AMO revenue and frxETH revenue (not distributed at this time). The current yield for veFXS holder is 1.83% APR. This should increase sharply once Frax beings to distribute frxETH fees. Ethereum Shanghai upgrade will lead to more ETH staked with Frax and higher fees for the protocol. Lido’s ETH staking dominance threatens Ethereum’s security ecosystem and leads to users flocking to other LSD protocols. Frax’s core mission is to build stablecoins and will soon launch frxBTC. Frax plans to replace WETH with frxETH as the primary ETH pairing for LPs. When Frax starts distributing the 8% sfrxETH fees to veFXS holders, it will increase yields significantly. Let's look at a projection for LSD Protocols over the next 2 years. LSD P/S protocol projections in terms of ETH The highlighted P/S ratio for frxETH is a conservative estimate that frxETH might achieve. At the end of 2023 and 4% market share, Frax’s P/S ratio is 1/4 as compared to the current P/S ratio and a value much closer to its competitors. RocketPool has the best P/S due to its high market share and fees, but with Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) being added soon, it seems that the Rocketpool model of decentralized staking might become obsolete. With the potential catalyst mentioned, I am confident that Frax might even outperform the 2024 & 2025 conservative estimates as more products are built out using frxETH. LSD protocols received their fair share of attention during January, but the narrative was cut short due to AI and ZK narratives quickly gaining popularity. Due to the PvP market environment that we are in, LSD protocols were dumped for the next narrative making the rounds on Crypto Twitter. LDO, FXS & RPL underperformed the market during this time. Thus, this might be a good chance to accumulate FXS before the LSD narratives come back in full swing. As Shanghai approaches, all eyes will be on ETH and all of its LSD protocols as the direct beta for the event. Currently, many users are not staking ETH due to the lock-up and peg deviation of staked ETH. Only 14% ETH is staked, while other L1s have greater than 30% staked. With Lido dominating ~30% of the staked ETH supply, it will pose a potential risk that many Ethereum watches have flagged. So while frxETH is the highest-yielding LSD, it could be an attractive choice for many making the switch after Shanghai. The frxETH-ETH LP will be able to handle any outflows immediately after the upgrade, and should scale with future inflows (frxETH Minter). This in turn generates more fees for Frax from both staking and LPing. Frax being the primary stablecoin issuer for ETH and BTC is its biggest bullish factor as to why it will outperform ETH. To replace WETH, Frax will have to create trading pairs with frxETH and incentivise protocols to pair up with frxETH. Frax has the assets (CVX) and a strong reserve of Frax stablecoin that they can fall back on. Using the FRAXBP as ~$700M TVL or the Frax liquidity AMO can mint Frax based on the protocol collateralization ratio to create a flywheel as follows: Once frxETH gets paired with tokens, the above flywheel will play out, resulting in a net positive for the Frax ecosystem. Replacing WETH and WBTC is an extremely tough job, but the Frax team always delivers, as seen from their full suite of products. Betting on FXS is equivalent to betting on the DeFi ecosystem as a whole (FRAX, frxETH, Fraxswap, Fraxlend, Fraxferry (Bridge), FPI). All these products and primitives are part of the Frax ecosystem and will help expand its foothold to other networks. All in all, the main factor why FXS can outperform ETH is due to the attention from Shanghai upgrade and the broader LSD narrative. As frxETH accumulates more market share, Frax will have a healthy source of income, solidifying FXS as a revenue-generating token. ",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/analysis-the-frax-stablecoin-thesis
5,"We’re putting this first because of the importance, but we were SHOCKED when Sam dropped the tweet.  WETHR (see below) had just been posted to Curve forum and no more than 30 min later this tweet rocked our timelines. The hype was real in the Frax TG and Sam K tried to keep it tight lipped, but leaked a few things once he started getting peppered with questions. First, Frax v3 is an upgrade for FRAX the stablecoin. It’s a part of a wider roadmap for the Frax protocol.  Next, Frax v3 is more than just stability mechanism updates. It’s about making Frax safer, especially in light of the events of the last 18 months. We’re really interested to see how Sam is planning to shift Frax away from USDC and other fiatcoins to USD. There’s no current alternatives, so a new solution must be cooking.  He also mentioned on-chain governance, which we he covered in one of our recent interviews. This would allow veFXS holders to veto any multi-sig actions before they get executed.  The switch to USD is not about a master account, its a “pure crypto design for v3,” which might be the most interesting part. How they approach this, we’re going to be covering closely.  Last, user “N” asked the question we all were wondering.  Frax has announced the initial details of its WETH replacement program on the Curve governance forum. First, it asked for new gauges for the following pairs: Once added, these pools will “get FXS bribes through Votium proportional to their TVL using a similar algorithm to the FRAXBP system.” This is the beginnings stages of frxETH’s DeFi takeover of liquidity. If all LSD ETH pairs against frxETH due to the highest yields, Frax wins. We don’t even have to have the highest TVL, but frxETH becomes the core liquidity component required for every LSD. A “flatcoin” is a term first used in a conversation by Sam K and Balaji many years back.  A flatcoin is a stablecoin that is pegged to something other than fiat currency. Last year Frax deployed the first “flatcoin” when it launched FPI. Deploying FPI to Base would require the protocol to create the token and system contracts on the network. The DAO could then vote to open up a Fraxferry channel. Even with FPI being deployed to Base, the collateral backing it would remain on ETH. Deployment of AMO funds into Flux would also go against Frax’s commitment to only hold funds in an FMA. Off-chain assets, while profitable, create centralization risk. A better option for Flux would be to apply for a single sided fFRAX gauge. Individuals could choose for themselves if they wanted to provide liquidity and take on the pool risks.  Sean Kelley asks about the Frax logo in names Sam K answers a question about Fraxferry wait times Sam K responds to front end issues A discussion about FPI maintaining its peg. Sam K gets asked about the Mint Cap for FPI later in the conversation",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/this-week-in-frax
7,"w 20 years on from its launch, internet life is so pervasive that we don’t even think about it anymore. It just is. But the ideas learned from the early days of persistent online gameplay still run deep. If I can buy a $10,000 item in the WoW store at 4am, why can’t I send a similar amount of money from my bank? Madness really. Banks are collapsing, payment rails are under pressure in the wake of Covid-19, the Russian war, and Chinese regional expansion. America’s response to every crisis is further weaponization of the dollar. And while this might achieve short term national strategy objectives, in the long term it dissuades dollar usage abroad and could lead to the end of the dollar over the next century.  This narrative is exactly what Bitcoin bulls have been waiting for. Stress on the banking system and geopolitical tensions should push people into Bitcoin as a flight to safety. We’ve seen some inflows into Bitcoin, as its 80% off of its lows at $15,000, but the next leg up to $100k will require new broader narratives and a fresh path for capital to flow into it.  Ansem makes the point that Bitcoin has to lead in this macro cycle and onwards. While the world burns, Bitcoin should be a flight to safety.  It’s extremely hard to build network security for Alt-L1s. Every new network has to compete for investment and builders to remain competitive. Usually these L1s have massive ecosystem grant pools to dole out to promising builders with the hope of one of them striking it big But we may be in a new regime with the launch of Optimism and Arbitrum tokens. Now builders don’t have to leave Ethereum’s inner circle. Builders can focus on doing what they do best. Security is guaranteed by the base layer. It’s a nice seperation that reduces fees based in ETH. The question now might be “what is the best L2 infra look like?” Is it a generalized roll-up? ZK EVM? modular roll-ups? It’s too early to tell, but these new additions might soon turn other L1s to being less secure side chains against ETH.  Mobile Thesis We have to solve crypto UX for mobile if its ever going to take off. Right now most mobile apps are pretty obtuse to use and require a lot of patience. If crypto is ever going to succeed, we will need better apps so any normie feels right at home.  But there are so many questions when it comes to mobile about security. How are keys supposed to be held? What happens if you lose your phone? What sort of hardware protects your private keys? These are super basic questions that have been solved on desktop/laptops already, but don’t have a great answer for mobile.  Ansem thinks the Solana phone might be a good option or the Saga phone.  Ansem thinks that eventually all countries will hold Bitcoin and other digital assets like the hold gold. While this has been widely discussed in the Bitcoin before, his smart take was that the biggest impact will be countries will start to compete in the mining space to protect their investments.  Nations will be incentivized to running mining operations so that they can maintain the network their assets are on. This might be direct operation of the infrastructure, or providing a means for private entities to do so with added tax breaks for labor and electricity.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/top-5-takeaways-from-our-interview
8,"FraxBP - 114% of 3Pool, down 4% from last week’s FraxCheck FraxLend - Added two new pairs MKR and APE as well as a new v3 sfrxETH pool AMO - Currently at a loss of $180k, but could potentially be flat this month. Let’s begin with the flagship product: FRAX stablecoin.  The supply remained flat this week.  However, the peg fluctuated violently between 1.002 and 0.991.  When checking the Curve markets, we swapped 100M of FRAX to receive an exchange rate of 0.9989 — not too bad.  We strive for a near 0.998+ exchange rate for similar-stable assets.   The Collateralization percent conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. We’re unchanged at 92%. Following we have the Decentralize percent, which is also unchanged and are now sitting at 23.9%.  For this week we saw the FraxBP TVL dropped to $487.3M, which is -1.3% from last week. Also, we look at the volume traded. For context, in February we hit 49.3M, and in March we hit 210M – we gained 16M over the last week. This represents a 43% utilization rate. The stablecoin trading volume has been ridiculously profitable for Curve this month.   We are 114% of 3pool. We decreased by 4% since last week. We’re still above 100%! The FraxBasedPool is $487M versus 3pool's $425M. What’s concerning is that the FraxBP dropped $6M and the 3Pool gained $6M. Now, it wasn’t easy to get to the top but now we must stay at the top. Next, we have our FrxETH segment. We start by checking the frxETH supply. As always, it’s up only! The count is at 125,803, +3.9% WoW -- not terrible but we prefer a 5% WoW. Let’s look at where the frxETHs are hanging out! As a reminder, frxETH could be staked into the sfrxETH vault to earn the native ETH staking yield – which is printing a nice 6.4%. And in that vault we see that 62% of the frxETH is chilling and stacking ETH earning a nice native staking yield. The other place frxETH can be put to work is in the curve pool of frxETH/ETH, where 30% of the frxETH supply is currently at. The remainder 8% is floating in the ether somewhere. We think the yield parity between the sfrxETH and Curve pool is reflected in the current split. Unless Frax cranks up the bribes a bit more, we think we’ll see this heavier flow into sfrxETH. But enough talk of the supply and the yield, let’s get down to the peg. Peg check is at a solid 0.9992. Let’s check the market. We tried to swap a 3500 frxETH which is roughly the amount of the largest frxETH holder and we get an exchange rate of 0.9976. Not too bad considering we got as low as 0.9950 two weeks ago. But we still don’t like to see a number 7 there, these are similar assets so the exchange rate should remain above 0.998. Fortunately, the TVL is quite sticky at $121M, still 9 SOLID FIGURES. So far so good, let’s see how we stack up with the other competitors. Here we layout the LSD market landscape. We have Lido in the lead with 74.5% of the market. Though, Frax REMAINED the highest 30-day delta in the group, at +22.2%. FrxETH’s market share is at 1.6%, gained 0.05% over the last week!. Let’s keep fighting the good fight! On the yield landscape, frxETH pretty much dominates with 6.4% and the closest competitor is Stakewise with 4.8%.  Quick refresher, FPI is a Frax Price Index, which is a stablecoin that tracks inflation. This is the first product of its kind on chain. Let’s run through the numbers! So far, we have 82.3M supply of FPI, the current inflation reading is 6.0% and the FPI peg is ABOVE by 0.37% of its mandated peg. The FPI Treasury is used to generate yield to maintain the peg. FPI’s treasury is at $88.3M, which is comprised of FPI, FRAX, and a small percentage holding of FXS. 95% of the treasury is in the FPI/FRAX convex. All these assets are put to work just like in the AMO to earn that needed yield to keep FPI at the inflation peg. These assets managed to produce $4.3M above the amount needed to maintain FPI at the peg, therefore we have what we like to call “equity” for the veFPIS of $4.3M. Next we have our FraxLend section. We remained pretty flat at $143M in TVL with $37M in borrowed FRAX. The Utilization rate increased by 11% from a week ago, now its at 66%. From the two charts, we see that the Supply Value of FRAX just took a nose dive alongside with the Collateral Value but both saw a nice bump, and now flattening. We pretty much hit reset on both of these values and started near the beginning of FraxLend again. Currently, there are many pairs being offered on FraxLend but more and more are being added. Also look at the current highest Supply APY we have none other than the sfrxETH/FRAX pair but note this is the v2 and we’re migrating to v3. Then right behind it is the gOHM/FRAX pair at 8.8%. A little further down the list you see there’s the CRV/FRAX pool with a juicy 7.1% APY. Some new pairs are the MKR and APE pair! The last leg of the Stablecoin Maximalism, the DEX aka FraxSwap. Per DeFi Llama, the TVL is $66M with a 149M monthly volume for March. We took the Monthly volume divided by the TVL to get a utilization rate of 225% — pretty well utilized for a DEX no one knows about. Finally, let’s jump into our profitability section starting with an overview of the AMO holdings.  The grand total of all AMOs is at $916M, we experienced a 0.5% decrease over the last week. The Curve AMO is $623M, Liquidity AMO is at $72M, Lending $85M, and Investor $131M. It’s going to take us quite some time to regain all these assets into the treasury from the shakeout from USDC but Flywheel DeFi will be here every week reporting in on every step of the journey. Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. For the month of March, we have $1.43M in revenue and $1.6M in bribe expense, which means we are at a loss of $180k for March. The lionshare of the revenue came from CRV at $1.23M, that’s 86% of the Convex AMO revenue.  We believe we may end the month very close to being flat! Will report back next week with the final count.

9,"Hello Mrs. Cathie Wood, The one thing that always bothered me about Bitcoin and all these other cryptos, and forgive me for this, is why don't they find an algorithm that guarantees the value of the unit and lets the quantities vary rather than controlling the quantity of the unit and letting the price vary. People care about price stability over the long run. Yes. When I make a contract with someone for 20 years out, I wanna know what the value of the unit numeraire is gonna be back then. Not the quantity of it. I wanna know the value of it. And why can't these little geniuses, all these people with computers, I have a flip phone. Why can't you guys find some cryptocurrency that has a stable value rather than a quantity, fixed quantity, and that's what just bugs the live and poop outta me about these cryptos. They need a value crypto, not a quantity crypto.  Immediately, upon listening to this I fired off a quick tweet. Now that I have more time after the weekend, and I don't have to look after my kids. I wanted to spend a bit more time to explain Frax and its inflation pegged stablecoin FPI. You refer to Bitcoin as both a money and also an investment. It is able to transfer value, but its value is highly volatile.  Bitcoin is a ""suboptimal"" commodity money as a result. More so, its bad for finance, as it's difficult to draft any type of contract in bitcoin that would project future prices. It's also extremely difficult to imagine large amounts of loans being taken in bitcoin due to its price volatility. Who in the right mind would want to take a loan that could potentially grow in size 20 times by the time it's term ended. Bitcoin alone is just not enough. Demand for fiat money is always going to exist, and it will only grow as bitcoin grows, as fiat money is the best money to take loans with. I wholeheartedly doubt that will ever be able to discharge debt-based fiat money for some alternative, even with all of its unsightly deficiencies. Our greatest fear though, should be a monopolization of money into one single type. Until Bitcoin came along, Cash was the best check against unfettered monetary incursions. Now, Bitcoin also falls into that same roll, simultaneously adversarial and beneficial. Ultimately, Bitcoin does one thing well, which is to be an immutable means of payment on the Internet. I'm just a crypto pleb, and so what I know about economics is mostly derives from Twitter and other random places on the Internet. But what I have been able to gather is that economists think in terms of maximizing the capabilities of individuals and businesses to make rational choices about their future consumption. We need to be able to say with moderate certainty, a defined basket of goods or cost X today, and probably Y tomorrow. If everyone believes this, then it typically happens. It's honestly the strangest thing about economics to me. Everyone talks about inflation, but nobody really understands how it works. There's a deeper level of human psychology, underlying economics, obfuscating, logical outcomes. It's so weird that price increases can become anchored, and that no matter what a government does, or says, people just keep on marking prices up without explanation. Honestly, the entire system is crazy; we have an ever-expanding federal government that desperately is in need of buyers for its debt. Without them, they wouldn't be able to fund any of their operations. To drive demand, they devalue the base currency just a little bit each year and incentivize conditions within commercial banks for private entities to take new loans that hopefully benefit the economy long-term.  It's hard to think about what money would be like if it was disconnected from government. The MMT people naturally assume that money is just a tool the state, that needs to be regulated and controlled. I don't even know if we can imagine a world anymore with an independent money. Maybe this is why the dream of crypto is so alluring. To be able to return to a fable time, a libertarian fantasy, where the state is the functional output of a representative class.  Maybe we just take it for granted, the power of the purse and government’s monopoly on it. We don't really have any viable alternatives to compare and so we're forced to dream of various crypto Ponzi's hoping one finally achieves this vaunted goal. Bitcoin has been able to build a system of money that is completely independent of any government or existing monetary order. It is not captured politically. It is not a tool controlled by anyone. And it makes no assumptions about pricing power or stability. It's just code that anybody can run. Simple. As soon as you move away from this model, towards connecting real life with immutable assets, there are trade-offs that have to be made. Governments are ruthless when it comes to control of their monetary monopoly. Wars have been fought over who will have the right to print. Today, we face these challenges again as stablecoins are pushing the boundaries of what digital money can be. The idea that Mr. Laffer put forward tries to thread the needle between the current form of the dollar and a bond. Both monetary assets have a value, and they're also guaranteed with the full faith in force of government. However, these assets are easily devalued and rely on the steady breeze of political winds to maintain course.  It’s antithetical to the current monetary system to guarantee a fixed value over an extended period of time. It wouldn’t make sense for the government to issue this type of money that tracks, inflation, or a basket of goods, because the monetary authorities must preserve their ability to issue a new specie whenever they didn’t fit. When they do issue inflation protected assets like Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), there are strict limits on how much can be bought and high fees for redeeming early. The closest form that we have to this inflation targeting money in traditional finance, are money market funds. And while they might be a cash like substitute, their values can waver in times of market stress, like during 2008 or 2020. When investors lose faith in the ability of the short term bond market to maintain liquidity money market funds have lost their peg. Additionally, money market funds are a security, making him an extremely poor substitute as a daily payment currency. We need a better solution. Enter FPI by Frax.  Like I mentioned above, FPI is an inflation tracking stablecoin. FPI works pretty simply. You swap your FRAX stablecoin for FPI and the protocol goes out and figures out the best way to earn yield with it. Frax deploys collateral using Automatic Market Operations (AMOs), into a variety of different on-chain protocols and applications across a variety of networks.  It then uses the CPI-U number provided by Chainlink to adjust the FPI peg up or down over the course of a month after its officially released each month. In the future, the idea is to use on-chain voting to determine what’s in the basket of assets its tracking and also its value. As long as Frax can earn a higher amount of yield than inflation FPI will work in the long term. To handle periods of high inflation or when the protocol cannot earn enough yield, FPI has a buffer of reserves that can be drawn from. Currently, there is an excess of $4.4m held by the protocol.  FPI isn’t perfect. You might earn better yield keeping your cash in a MMF. A wave of high inflation might bankrupt the product. Or maybe, Mr. Laffer’s dream currency won’t ever be used by the general public. It’s too early to tell. We can say though for certain that FPI exists, its maintained its peg since launch, and Frax has profited from operating the product almost every month. When the hard cap of $100m is lifted later this year we will see if it can handle the expansion, but I do think the pegged can be maintained at size.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/dear-cathie-wood-yes-we-have-an-inflation
10,"The buyback fund was authorized after the LUNA collapse of last year. It authorized the protocol to purchase up to $20 million worth of FXS, however only $2 million has been bought at this point. Additionally, new gauges are expected once the FIP passes. This could be the beginning of a new liquidity regime on the L2 network. Our friends at Reserve were very excited this week as the gauge for the eUSD-FRAXBP Curve LP started. In just one week the TVL of the LP sextupled in size to $6 million. Catch up on Reserve with our latest interview with Thomas Mattimore below. Well, the USDC drama caused the markets to go into a tailspin for a weekend, one of the benefits of all of the on-chain activity was that sfrxETH’s yields for this week were absolutely insane. Frax’s validators received more than 80 ETH from MEV and Tips during the calamity. You would have returned to their normal levels, but it is exciting to see how validators will perform in adverse market conditions. C2tP dropped in the chat this past week and announce the launch of cvxFPIS staking. Convex doesn't really know yet how they're going to use the pools because there's not that much documentation in the moment, but the protocol is committed to ensuring some of the highest yields for veFPIS that you can get.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/this-week-in-frax-march-19-24th-2023
11,"In the past month, the failure of three high profile banks has led many to question the very nature of our banking system. Notably, Silicon Valley Bank, the 16th largest bank in the United States failed after $42 billion in demand deposits were withdrawn from the bank in 24 hours, throwing stablecoins like USDC into the lurch over a tenuous weekend. While in hindsight the event was overblown, it raised new questions about the role of banks and how we should treat demand deposits. For those of you who are unfamiliar with how banking works, you give your cash to a depository institution, which then goes out and invests your collateral into various assets, mostly debt. The bank turns a profit as it pays less interest on short-term deposits than it receives on its longer-term investment portfolio. On a basic level banking is a way for capital to be distributed most economically, where those with excess capital can find yield, and those seeking credit can capitalize on their business ideas. In a fair and equitable world without risk, Bank runs would never happen as the banking institution’s lending facility would only give money to those who would repay, and the economy would never turn in a way, which would affect the ability of creditors to repay their debts. However, we don't live in that society. There is always risk in accepting short-term deposits and lending out on a longer term. There is no way to obfuscate or completely hedge or annihilate this risk. Managing this risk is what the bank does, it's its core function to create new money through the issuance of loans. No doubt, the world has been an unsettling place for the last month. For me, it's been one of the few times in my entire career in crypto that I've questioned my continued time inputs and commitments. The last time was in March 2021 when Bitcoin hit $4000. It seemed like Bitmex was about to bring the entire market to its knees. Before that, it was floundering in the depths of 2018, where every ICO seemed like a scam and the joy ride of Bitcoin’s bull run was never to be again. And originally it was the collapse of mount Cox and the crash from $1000 by bitcoin that seem to kick this entire industry off. Time and time again, these networks have shown resilience. Even in the face of unprecedented, massively destructive volatility, our industry has emerged stronger than ever. I bring this up because it's scary. The collapse of these banks is going to be used by a certain political faction to try and ram new banking regulations through Congress in the name of protecting depositors. In the past hundred years since the creation of the Federal Reserve, there have been significant changes and regulations imposed on banks that have limited their activities and forced them to keep reserves at a certain level, as well as a multitude of other changes, which have increased the complexities of running a bank. Additionally, the growth of multinational global depository institutions and the emergence of the eurodollar have created a system that vastly preferences a few banks in the United States. 100 years ago if you wanted to take a loan you would go to a small regional bank run by a local banker who understood the ebbs and flows of the community. These banks still exist, and they are responsible for the vast majority of industrial and commercial loans inside the United States. However, there has also been the emergence of a new type of bank, deemed ""systemically important."" These banks are subject to different rules than the small local regional commercial banks and Lauren portly when it comes to protections they are considered “too big to fail.” After 2008 we learned that these systemically important banks would be protected by the United States government no matter what. That their failures would reverberate globally and create financial shock waves beyond our wildest expectations. I'm reminded of the Japanese earthquake and tsunami of 2011 which began as a powerful event off the northeastern coast of Honshu, Japan's main island. The tsunami caused widespread damage on land and created a series of tsunami waves that devastated the coast and killed thousands. A collapsing bank is much like an earthquake, tension is built up over an extended period, and then rapidly released. Buildings can be designed in a way, which mitigates the undulations of the earthquake, but there is little that can be done to protect against the swell of millions of gallons of water, rushing on shore, and sweeping everything along with it. The Great Financial Crisis of 2008 started with the collapse of a single bank, Bear Stearns, and lead to global shockwaves, leading to the collapse of hundreds of financial institutions and the destruction of trillions of dollars of credit. The excesses of the banks at the time were documented, but poorly understood. How could these financial institutions know that lending to subprime borrowers, then packaging up the debt into strange new synthetic products, sold the banks worldwide, and then used to lever up could cause such destruction? In hindsight, it seems so clear. We allowed these institutions to engage in extremely risky activities with the explicit backing of governments. In the aftermath, significant regulatory changes were made to ensure that this type of egregious behavior could never take place again. In the wake of the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank, there have been open calls for the United States government to ensure that all uninsured depositors at all US banks are protected from losses due to poor investment choices, made yet again by banking institutions. Approximately 43% of domestic deposits are uninsured today, exceeding $7 trillion. This money created by private commercial banks represents the global engine of innovation and capitalism. Over the last decades, we've allowed a regime of monetary expansion to create vast new riches of money through debt, now it's sitting at the precipice of capital destruction, through the failure of the banks and their poor investment schemes. Those who have benefited from this governmental mitigation of risk are now calling for further protections from the government to prop up a monetary regime of their own making. Wealthy individuals and companies with large cash balances in banks were able to disproportionately benefit from a low-interest rate regime created by monetary easing. They are now calling for a complete re-imagination of the banking system to protect their profits, held in depository institutions, and unfortunately, governments around the world will most likely cater to them because capital destruction or deflation is anathema to a credit-based money system. By providing deposit insurance in unlimited amounts to all demand deposits, the United States government will be de facto, nationalizing the banks and explicitly asserting their status as franchises of the sovereign money power. Money by principle will be guaranteed by the government and will become a matter of public policy. In exchange, the regulators will ask for far more intrusive accountability, and regulations on the ability of banks to create new credit and engage in specific activities. As a result, money will explicitly enter the domain of politics, and regulators and politicians will use their power to choose winners and losers in the financial ecosystem. This is the wrong way. We need a system where those who just want to bank to store their money can do so. We also need a system, where a network of private commercial banks can create money through lending activities. I would assume that most people and institutions would prefer this dichotomy of choices, instead of the current regime, which pigeonholes all depositors into the same risk profile. The only way to currently escape the risks of demand deposit loss as a result of bank failures is to move money into systemically important banks. We need alternatives, banks that don't engage in lending, that don't subject their deposits to risk investments, and even supposedly riskless ones like US treasuries. Oh, the irony, that Custodia bank was denied its membership application to the federal reserve system on the eve of the second-largest bank collapse in the United States. Custodia had planned to keep a collateral ratio of 108% for all demand deposits and additionally, not engage in any lending activities that would subject those deposits to risk. The Fed claimed that Custodia's business plan was ""inconsistent with required factors under the law"" and that also ""the firm's novel business model and proposed focus on crypto assets, present significant safety, and soundness risks."" Now that the dust has settled on Silvergate and Signature bank, it's clear that Custodia was targeted by the current administration for its associations with crypto, yet it would have survived any bank run that destroyed other banks like Silicon Valley Bank. The biggest mistake that we can make is to assume that a special set of policymakers, economists, or other people who study money have a special insight into how our monetary and financial systems work. Markets are intentionally opaque, and cannot be understood through mystic gnostic rituals like the monthly Fed meetings. We need a market, derived solutions that help depositors, shareholders, bondholders, and other entities with fiduciary responsibilities to make smart investment choices. Into products they see best fit for themselves and their businesses. It's going to be easy to fall into a trap of ""we must act,” as a result of the past few months. It's in times of calamity that we typically see the greatest amount of our individual and collective power to the government. 9/11 led to the Patriot Act, 2008 lied to Dodd-Frank, in the great depression led to Glass-Steagall. Chaos provides the best opportunity for political factions to assert their beliefs and enshrine their desired powers. I don't think that money is a public good that needs to be managed by the government and an opaque group of unelected bureaucrats. Money needs to exist in a highly transparent, private, and competitive market. In today's age of money, billions of dollars can be transferred from one account to another with a single keystroke or API. We need to rethink what money is and what it means to us as a society at large, and how we deal with the risks of it moving at light speed. A transparent open and permissionless infrastructure provides a system, where an institution's or DAO's balance sheet is visible at all times. It would beg the question of what sort of social structure would be enacted on the banks themselves if this were the case. The alchemy of banks borrowing short without lockups and lending long would probably disappear. Riskier credit creation and lending would move to banks that charge appropriate fees and interest for the service. Bailouts wouldn't be necessary, because the core retail depository base would be protected in these ""Narrow Banks.” The true cost of money can't be found in the current environment, as art institutions have been relieved of the moral hazards of credit, duration, and interest-rate risk. We must act in a way to liberate ourselves from the politicization of money and ensure free and open markets to remain the bastion of capitalism into the next centu",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/should-money-be-a-public-good
12,"Let’s face it, although Uniswap v3 has revolutionized DEX’s and trading on-chain, it’s simply hard provide liquidity in a sustainable fashion unless you know what you are doing. It’s no wonder why Kassandra has framed Uniswap v3 as a “liquidity computer” and with any computer, you need to have the right interface.  Arrakis Finance is a protocol designed for liquidity providers who want to have their liquidity managed in a more automated, capital-efficient, non-custodial, and transparent manner. Overall, Arrakis provides the tools to program the “low-level language” of liquidity positions which are injected at various ranges that minimize risks and maximize fees.  Ok, that might seem like a lot, but let’s break down how Uniswap V2 is inadequate for market making and how and Uniswap V3 works.  This 50/50 token ratio generalized liquidity across the full range of prices from 0 to infinity. It didn’t matter how the asset prices were trading, only the ratio was important. So when someone adds or subtracts assets from the liquidity pool, it implicitly means that prices are assumed to have changed. Uniswap V2 is a weighing machine at its core.  The problem with V2 contracts is that no professional market maker provides liquidity in a 50/50 fashion. Liquidity is never a constant function on centralized exchanges. Depending on market conditions, market makers will adjust their bids and offers to maximize their potential returns. Seen below, bid and asks add up in a natural way based on the market makers assumptions on risk and availability of liquidity to arbitrage against.  Market makers are able to control the spread, the amount of difference between the bid and ask so they can remain profitable over the long term and manage their inventory. Uni V2 LPs provide liquidity equally across the entire price curve, which reduces the capital efficiency since most assets trade within a range.  Let’s start with a simple example, stablecoin to stablecoin pairs. If you have a pool where both assets should trade at $1 all of the time, the Uni V2 formula is suboptimal, as it has ever increasing slippage as prices diverge away from the start. The optimal way to trade a stablecoin pair would be to provide liquidity only between $0.99 and $1.01. Providing liquidity outside of that range would not net any trading fees and would represent unused capital. Uniswap V3 introduced several new features and improvements over the previous versions, including concentrated liquidity, multiple fee tiers, and range orders. Another significant change in Uniswap V3 is the introduction of multiple fee tiers. In Uniswap V2, the fee was a fixed 0.30%, but in Uniswap V3, liquidity providers can choose between 5 different fee tiers ranging from 0.01% to 1%. This allows liquidity providers to customize their fees based on their risk tolerance and the level of demand they expect for their liquidity. Uniswap V3 also introduces the concept of range orders, which allows traders to specify a price range and a limit order that will execute if the price falls within that range. This feature is especially useful for traders who want to take advantage of price movements within a specific range, and it allows for more precise trading strategies. Given all of this, Uniswap V3 now becomes a liquidity computer for protocols like Arrakis Finance, where the exact placement of assets and fees can be optimized in a way to mimic CEX market making using their vaults. Vaults are the vehicles that carry all the features of Arrakis V2 and serve as the interface where users can deposit liquidity into the protocol. There are two types of vaults: Private and Public. Private vaults only allow whitelisted addresses to deposit liquidity into them, while Public vaults allow anyone to deposit liquidity. There are three different manager types for vaults: Additionally Arrakis V2 also enables: Ability to create multiple concentrated liquidity positions Cross fee tier vaults Inventory management for LPing with customizable options Cross-protocol rebalancing for liquidity across different protocols and DEXs Non-custodial security for liquidity deposited by arbitrary depositors Fungibility of Arrakis V2 vaults for easy integration into DeFi and use as collateral in lending markets. So given the stablecoin example from before, using an Arrakis V2 vault, liquidity can now be deployed closest to $1 with the lowest fees, and then decrease in size and raise fees moving away from $1.  On the other hand, for volatile assets, inventory near the spot price can be reduced and moved outwards to simulate a typical CLOB spread.  One of the biggest reasons to use Arrakis as a liquidity provider is that during setup, it creates all of the necessary Uniswap V3 NFTs beforehand, decreasing the total gas consumed by traders over the life of the product. Previously, when prices would go out of range on Uniswap V3, traders would have to withdrawal all of their liquidity and create a new NFT. This can be especially expensive during high gas environments.  Now Uniswap V3 ranges become inputs where the set of all NFTs within a range can be determined and then capital can be deployed based on modeled outcomes using fees, spread, and volatility. Uniswap V3 becomes a liquidity computer.  The main problem with figuring out liquidity for tokens is how and who to market make with. Typically a project signs a fixed term or month-to-month contract that lends the market maker inventory to trade. The MM then uses their systems to deploy capital in a way which they believe is most efficient. Unfortunately, these systems are black boxes, where projects cannot fully see the operations of the MM and depend on them to act in a ethical manner.  PALM stands for Protocol Automated Liquidity Management, Arrakis’ answer to opaque market makers.  PALM allows any protocol to build and maintain deep liquidity using their market making strategies built on top of Arrakis V2. It’s requires partnering with the Arrakis team, who then run backtesting and other simulations to optimize how liquidity is deployed on Uniswap V3. It doesn’t matter if a project is just launching or has been trading for an extended period of time, PALM can handle any situation.  Arrakis Finance takes its name from the legendary epic of DUNE as an unforgiving planet full of as many dangers as there are riches. It only takes one false move to jeopardize a strategy which makes the stakes that much higher. After years of experience and backtesting, Arrakis Finance aims to capture and provide on Uniswap v3 and beyond by cultivating a community of managers and trusted partners. Will they be able to continue to lead the way? For the sake of the spice, we hope so. Not financial or tax advice.

13,"Welcome to Frax Check. We will be going straight to the source of truth via checking the chain. Before we jump in, please subscribe Flywheel DeFi, it really does help!  This week... Kiet named it “Normalizing” week. As the name suggests, things are falling back into place. Let’s start with the flagship product, the $FRAX stablecoin. Supply has been holding steady at $1B-ish, unchanged from last week, even after everything that happened. Next, checking the peg, it went as low as $0.996 with a high of $1.001 for the week – things are returning to normal.  Swapping 100M FRAX for USDC via Curve gives a 0.9991 exchange rate.  This is the percentage that conveys how much FXS and other digital assets (algorithmic) are used as collateral. It is unchanged at 92%. The Decentralization ratio increased 1.7% and is now at 23.5%.  The FraxBP Total Value Locked (TVL) increased to $493.6M, a +6% increase from last week. This was the first uptick in TVL in four weeks.  In February the Curve LP traded volume of 49.3m, and in the three weeks of March it hit 194m, an increase of 30m over the last week and a 39.3% utilization rate.Stablecoin trading volume has been ridiculously profitable for Curve this month. This week the FraxBP increased its TVL to 118% of 3pool, a 1% increase from last week. It looks like we’re sustaining this ratio!  The FraxBasedPool is $493m versus 3pool's $419m, gaining $30m over the last week. Now, it wasn’t easy to get to the top, but now we must stay at the top. The frxETH supply is 121,079, an increase of +5.1%; not too shabby. As frxETH supply matures, growth may slow down, but for now its still amazing. Currently, 58% of the frxETH is earning a nice native staking yield. The Curve FrxETH/ETH has 31% of the supply. The remaining 11% is floating in the ether somewhere. The yield parity between the sfrxETH and Curve pool is reflected in the current split. The peg check is back to one of its best rates ever at 0.9997. Swapping 3500, which is roughly the amount of the largest frxETH holder, gives a rate of 0.9980. Not too bad considering we got as low as 0.995 last week. Fortunately, the TVL is quite sticky at $124m, an increase of $10M from last week. Frax has the highest 30-day delta of the group, at +23.4%. FrxETH’s market share is at 1.55%. Lido lost 0.3% market share this week. Comparing yields, frxETH dominates with a 11% and the closest competitor is Lido with 5.6%. The rewards were higher this week due to massive MEV captured during the crazy market situation. The Frax Price Index (FPI) supply is 82.3m and is above the peg by 0.81%. FPI’s treasury is at $88.3M. Over the last week Fraxlend gained $30M of collateral, with 144m in TVL and $34m borrowed FRAX. The utilization rate dropped by 3% down to 63% from just a week ago. The highest supply APYs are the sfrxETH/FRAX at 8.9%, gOHM/FRAX at 8.5%, and CRV/FRAX with a juicy 6.5% APY.  Data from DeFiLlama shows TVL is $69m with $128m monthly volume for March so far. Taking the monthly volume divided by the TVL to get a utilization rate of 185% -- surprisingly this isn’t as high given the volume Curve experienced this last week The last leg of the Stablecoin Maximalism: the DEX aka FraxSwap. Per DeFi Llama, the TVL is $69M with 128M monthly volume for March so far. We just took the Monthly volume divided by the TVL to get a utilization rate of 185%. The grand total of all AMOs increased by 2.2% to 921m. The Curve AMO increased by 19m to $625m, Liquidity $85m, increased $10m, Lending $86m gained $6m, and Investor $135m.  Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. For the month of March, Frax had $670k in revenue and $890k in bribe expenses, which means its at a loss of $220k for March. Frax has a bribe payment coming up shortly so it will see higher losses for the month – with the market no longer in the echo bubble mode, this might be a red month for Frax. Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. For the month of March, we have $1m in revenue and $1.6m in bribe expense, which means a loss of $550k for March. Bribe payments were this week so that’s why the expense is quite high, but we have another week in March to make up for it.  Not financial or tax advice.

14,"A classic question that doesn't solve everything in crypto. Some products are just good enough to make money on their own without dropping a half-baked token for the sake of it. This is especially the case for websites, apps and other front end facing, retail consuming products.  What exactly does a token add? In most cases it’s used to govern the deployment and maintenance of smart contracts used by a distributed group of people. Tokens are also used to accrue value generated by the protocol through buybacks or distributions. Without a clear use case for a token, it can really detract from the overall health and growth of the actual product as moonbois only talk about price. As a founder, it can be extremely distracting to endure the constant barrage of questions why prices aren’t exactly tracking value on a daily basis and what is intended to pump prices as soon as possible.  If you can create a functioning business without a token, it’s the easiest method towards sustainability. But with open source software the licenses typically allow permissive modification and private use without many restrictions. Anyone can just “right click save” the code, deploying it how they wish and for their own purposes.  On Sunday March 20th, a schism erupted when lead developer of DeFiLlama posted this tweet: The move came as a shock to many in the community. What did 0xngmi mean by “hostile?” Who were the attackers leading the charge to takeover an open source project? What were the implications of moving to a new, but closely branded fork of the code? The initial response was more confusion than anything else as the situation was pieced together.  With two sides calling each other “rogue” and “hostile,” the public rift was apart of a long brewing internal fight between Charlie (0xLlam4) and company Director 0xngmi, who owns a 70% of DeFiLlama. Over a two year period, the majority of DeFiLlama’s expenses have been paid by donations. Minority shareholder Charlie funded server costs for the growing site, but stopped several months ago when the internal dispute started. 0xngmi has also contributed towards expenses during this time. But his biggest value has been as a prolific contributor to the DeFiLlama Github, with more than 2,000 commits in the last few years.  The whole situation spun publicly out of control just one day after the official DeFiLlama twitter account posted a long thread on the its growth and future. One of the last tweets named several “surprises” that were upcoming and finished the tweet with a parachute emoji.  The core issue was that Charlie wanted to issue a Llama token as a way to monetize the currently free site. However, no one else wanted to take the repetitional risk associated with launching a token for a product that arguably doesn’t need one. Ads, subscriptions, and other revenue generating alternatives are a better way to monetize. The reputational capital built up by 0xngmi and the rest of the team is more than enough at this point to test out new methods to monetize. A token should be the last option.   Ending the debate in LobsterDAO, Ivan was right on the sauce: DeFiLlama is one of many companies operated by the Llama group. It is majority owned by 0xngmi with Charlie as a minority shareholder. 0xngmi also owns a majority stake in LlamaSwap, LlamaPay and Llamalend. On the other hand, 0xLlam4 has a majority stake in DeFiLlama News, LlamaNodes, and Llamafolio. Charlie still controls the DeFiLlama Twitter and website front end. 0xngmi launched a sister site, llama.fi which is serving as a temporary front end until the two sides can negotiate a peaceful outcome. There are no risks to continue using either site.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/defi-llamad
15,"Thanks for reading Flywheel DeFi! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support our work to document Frax and DeFi. It’s fitting that we let the people speak for us. We agree. This last week was the biggest test to Frax since launch. For the first time ever, $FRAX deviated significantly off of its $1 peg. In all of the scenarios that we had spoken about internally, USDC custody risk was not among them. The team had so much faith in the USDC peg holding that they even hardcoded the USDC price at $1.  So when the news came out that Circle was holding $3.3bn USD at Silicon Valley Bank, both Frax and USDC fell together. In the chart below, FRAX actually did a fabulous job of tracking USDC. It never went off peg by more than 1%.  Unfortunately, this meant that FRAX traded down to $.88 cents alongside USDC during the panic. The decline really started to kick in on Friday night after Coinbase and Circle announced pausing withdrawals over the weekend.   It was a harrowing time, as during the crash, the protocol had no way to effectively change collateral. If USDC had gone to 0, FRAX would have gone down with it too. But as time went on and the fog of war dissipated, clear headed analysts figured out the hole in USDC’s balance sheet was not that bad. After 24 hours, Circle finally made an announcement that they had placed a wire request to SVB on Thursday before the crash and they believed it would be honored. Thankfully we never had to find out, as over the weekend, the US Government announced in tandem with the FDIC that SVB would be bailed out and all depositors would have access to their money on Monday.  In the wake of the crash, the Frax community seems firm in its resolve to keep USDC as its primary collateral backing. While there might be other stablecoins, they either do not have the same level of transparency or they don’t have enough liquidity to ensure functioning without high slippage and extra tail risks. USDC depeged only because it was highly transparent and its balance sheet was well known. If the same questions had been raised about USDT, the fallout might have been less as no one really knows where they keep their money and what the exact reserve amounts are.  Policy questions are going to be at the forefront of Frax’s growth from now on, as the protocol is firm in its quest to attain a Master Account at the Federal Reserve. Sam K has repeatedly said that this is the only way that would lead to long term growth and safety. Custody risk must be mitigated at all costs, especially as the supply of FRAX increases. In what can only be described as “stunning,” frxETH earned more than 80 ETH from MEV and tips in one day during the panic. It’s the highest amount of rewards ever earned by the protocol.  One good side effect of FRAX dropping below the peg is that Fraxlend debt became 10% cheaper. One person who scooped up a lot of FRAX to pay back their debts was Michael from Curve, used his CRV in Aave to buy up USDC/FRAX to pay back his loans.  We agree with Circle’s CEO Jeremy Allaire. We need to pass the STABLE Act. Stablecoins should be bank money, not stuck in limbo dependent on third party custody.

16,"The world on-chain can be dark and unforgiving. One false move could result in the catastrophic loss of your cheese. It is the faustian bargain we make, trading in convenience for sovereignty. The immutable ledger of Ethereum and other L1s require near-surgical precision when deploying contracts and when it comes to fixing them… well sheeeeiiit it demands both creativity and perseverance from those who seek the challenge. Luckily, there are brave devs out there who answer the call to traverse the dark forest and come out unscathed with once vulnerable funds now safu. On the very first episode of DeFi Dave’s Homebrew Tea, I got to one of those individuals, Mouse Dev. The seasoned NFT vet has been a dev for some time but his interest in crypto only peaked when he realized that “checking the chain” meant and not even a year later he was sharing stories from the front lines. If there is one thing for certain from hearing his stories, you have to respect the chain. Even when first meeting Mouse Dev, I knew his heart was in the right place. It’s devs like him that allow crypto natives whether they be DeFi degens, NFT hypebeasts, Hippie DAOists, and everyone in between to execute their transactions in peace. We all have a place in this world we are building and Mouse Dev shows that when you find your “ikigai,” the universe has a way of rewarding you. In this episode, we get deep into the chain and even the nature of cryptography itself. Hope you enjoy this one, you might learn a thing or two for the next time you decide to continue your journey on-chain.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/respecting-the-chain-w-mouse-dev
17,"Listen on Apple Music Reserve Protocol allows for the creation of stablecoins called RTokens. These RTokens are fully asset-backed by any combination of ERC-20 tokens and can be protected against collateral default by Reserve Rights (RSR) staking. Anyone can create an RToken by interacting with Reserve Protocol's smart contracts, which apply a system of factory smart contracts that allow for the deployment of custom smart contract instances. The protocol also enables the creator of an RToken to define its initial configuration, including which assets will back it, their respective weights in the basket, and how the RToken will be governed. The Reserve Protocol team discovered after the many algo-stablecoin blowups that their initial approach was not feasible on a larger scale for creating a stable, decentralized, and scalable stablecoin. People always find ways to exploit vulnerabilities for algo-stables at scale and they didn’t want another Luna collapse for those using Reserve. In their original design, Reserve Protocol planned to use a basket of cryptocurrencies and assets to create a stablecoin that would maintain a stable value against the US dollar. Then over time the reference value would shift to a basket of currencies to eventually decouple from the US dollar. The original design was very similar to Frax V1. After much research and experimentation, the Reserve Protocol team decided to adopt a different approach. They decided to create a protocol for creating stablecoins called RTokens. RTokens are stablecoins that are created on top of the Reserve Protocol. They are fully asset-backed by any combination of ERC-20 tokens and can be protected against collateral default by Reserve Rights (RSR) staking.  Each RToken is governed separately by its creators, and anyone can create an RToken by interacting with Reserve Protocol’s smart contracts or any user interface built on top of it. What’s cool is that anyone can use Reserve to create branded tokens with their own governing logic. During the initial configuration, the creator chooses the collateral assets RToken will be backed by, their weight in the basket, and how and by whom the RToken will be governed. They also get to set the fees taken from the interest yield, from 0-100%.  So hypothetically speaking… Flywheel DeFi could create their own Frax backed stablecoin that earns a yield from various DeFi apps like Aave, Compound, and or Frax. The interest earned on that stablecoin would have a fee, like 20% which would go to the Flywheel teams address. Flywheel could create a whole internal environment in which the token could be used, driving growth of the supply. While this example’s use is small, think about RTokens being used inside a AAA game, billions of dollars are transacted annually. It’s a really elegant solution that allows anyone to create a stablecoin.  This is where Reserve Rights (RSR) comes in. Holders can stake their tokens against various RTokens to receive a portion of the revenue the RToken makes in return. In case of a peg failure, like the one we saw this last week, staked RSR is the “lender of last resort” in the sense that their value is sold off to cover the losses to the collateral pool.  No, they are not. Any asset that is yield bearing can be issued as a stablecoin using Reserve. This means that any ETH LSD like frxETH could be rebranded to FlywheelETH and sold through a portal on our site. (Wow, mind blown). Again, the yield income derived from the total supply would fund the creator’s selected addresses. Think about a celebrity like Mr. Beast or Joe Rogan could create their own frxETH based stablecoins to sell to their subscribers, and then they could potentially make millions on the yield income. We’re entering into a new world of brand identity and value.  If all goes well, Reserve has the potential to be the core infrastructure for a stablecoin renaissance.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/how-to-build-your-own-stablecoin
18,"Welcome to Frax Check. Your weekly frax vibe check. I am your host Kapital_K and I’m joined by my cohost DeFi Dave and our producer extraordinaire Sam. We will be going straight to the source of truth via checking the chain. Before we jump in, please subscribe to the flywheel, it really does help! Please also follow us @flywheeldefi on Twitter and tg. This week... I call this week the “Speechless” week. As the name suggests, this week things were quite surreal. Let’s start with the flagship product: $FRAX stablecoin. We see the Supply has been holding steady at $1B-ish, unchanged from last week – even after the whole market turmoil. Next, we must check the peg, which got as low as $0.898 with a high of $1.001 for the week. The peg unfortunately was pegged to 1 USDC rather than 1 USD as we saw USDC got to the same low range. We then looked at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We received a 0.9992 exchange rate. This is frankly the best exchange rate we’ve seen for the FraxBP – if you’re wanting to trade from FRAX to USDC now is the time. Moving on, we have our Collateralization %. This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. We’re unchanged at 92%. Following we have the Decentralize %, which saw a decrease of 1.7% and are now sitting at 23.5%.  For this week we saw the FraxBP TVL dropped to $465.5M, which is -10.8% decrease from last week – tvl has declined three weeks in a row now. On the right side we have a new metric I wanted to start looking at which is the volume traded. For context, in February we hit 49.3M, and in first two weeks of March we hit 165M. This represents a 35.5% utilization rate. The Stablecoin trading volume has been ridiculously profitable for Curve this past week. Following this slide, we have a yield and bribes section, where I look at the current yield being offered to LP into this pool and the bribes Frax Finance had to pay for the yield. You see here that there’s an APR of 1.7% so the estimated $378k of yield for the 14-day epoch because Votium epochs are 14 days, then we compare that to the bribes paid. This epoch so far, we paid $241k so rough back of the envelope math says we’re doing pretty good so far this month. However it’s important to note that Frax Finance’s POL isn’t the only liquidity in the pool so its reward shares are definitely diluted but that’s part of the plan as Frax wants to attract liquidity into the FraxBP. To that end, $733 of liquidity were incentivized by $1 of bribes paid. Now, we march forward to my favorite section of the Frax Check. We are 117% of 3pool. Glad there are some good news in this week’s Frax Check. The FraxBasedPool is $465M versus 3pool's $396M. Now, it wasn’t easy to get to the top but now we must stay at the top. If we’re able to maintain this ratio, then I believe the FraxBP will continue to remain at the top as liquidity begets more liquidity.  The 3POOL is still highly imbalanced so I think it’s going to take some quite some time for it to find its footing again, while the FraxBP is near its best pool composition of 40/60.   Next, we have our FrxETH segment. We start by checking the frxETH supply. As always, it’s up only! The count is at 114,961. And look at that chart, I know you can’t read it but just appreciate the verticalness off that graph. +2.5% -- not too shabby. I do think we may slow down in percentage growth terms as we’re getting to size, but I hope we don’t! Let’s look at where the frxETHs are hanging out! As a reminder, You can stake your frxETH into the sfrxETH vault to earn the native ETH staking yield. And in that vault we see that 55% of the frxETH is chilling and stacking ETH earning a nice native staking yield. The other place you can take your frxETH is to the curve pool of frxETH/ETH, where you can join 37% of the frxETH supply. The remainder 8% is floating in the ether somewhere. I think the yield parity between the sfrxETH and Curve pool is reflected in the current split. Unless Frax cranks up the bribes a bit more, I think we’ll see this heavier flow into sfrxETH. And also lets note that there’s 9% of frxETH just chilling, this number is increasing more and more these last few weeks. But enough talk of the supply and the yield, let’s get down to the peg. Peg check is as lowest as it’s ever been at 0.9968. But it’s actually worst when we go into the market. I tried to swap a 3500 frxETH which is roughly the amount of the largest frxETH holder and I get an exchange rate of 0.9956. This is also a historic low. Fortunately, the TVL is quite sticky at $115M, still 9 SOLID FIGURES. So far so good, let’s see how we stack up with the other competitors. Here we layout the LSD market landscape. We have Lido in the lead with 74.8% of the market. Though, Frax REMAINED the highest 30-day delta in the group, at +22.8% so far. FrxETH’s market share is at 1.49%. Let’s keep fighting the good fight! On the yield landscape, frxETH pretty much dominates with a 6.5% and the closest competitor is surprisingly this week was Lido at 6.2%. But these figures on DeFi Llama doesn’t tell the full story as sfrxETH stakers earned 16%+ APR this week due to the massive MEV that it captured during the crazy market situation. Peg check could be better. Curve swap could be better. Count up-only. Staked % healthy. Next we have a new section I added. Another one of Frax’s product that might not get as much as love as the other products is FPI. Quick refresher, FPI is a Frax Price Index, which is a stablecoin that tracks inflation. This is the first product of its kind on chain. Let’s run through the numbers! So far, we have 82.3M supply of FPI, current inflation reading is 6.3% and the FPI peg is ABOVE by 0.81% of its peg. And you’re wondering how it maintains its peg to inflation, well that’s what the treasury is for. For the record, FPI’s treasury is at $88.2M. Similar to how the AMOs work for Frax stablecoin’s treasury, the FPI’s treasury is made up of FPI, FRAX, and a small percentage holding of FXS. As you can see 95% of the treasury is in the FPI/FRAX conve. The team deployed the 10% of FPI and FRAX that were sitting in the comptroller contract to add more stability to FPI. All these assets are put to work just like in the AMO to earn that needed yield to keep FPI at the inflation peg. Next we have our FraxLend section. We saw a massive drop in TVL of nearly $100M. We currently at 107M in TVL with $27M in borrowed FRAX. The Utilization rate dropped by 17% down to 66% from just a week ago. From the two charts, we see that the Supply Value of FRAX just took a nose dive alongside with the Collateral Value. We pretty much hit reset on both of these values and started near the beginning of FraxLend again. Currently, there are many pairs being offered on FraxLend but more and more are being added. Also look at the current Supply APY for gOHM/FRAX pair. A whopping 10.8%. then right behind it is the CRV/FRAX pair at 9.5%. A little further down the list you see there’s the sfrxETH/FRAX pool with a juicy 6.7% APY. Be sure to listen to our Governance Roundup to get any alpha on any future pairs. The last leg of the Stablecoin Maximalism: the DEX aka FraxSwap. Per DeFi Llama, the TVL is $65.6M with 85M monthly volume for March so far. I just took the Monthly volume divided by the TVL to get a utilization rate of 121% -- surprisingly this isn’t as high as what I thought we would see given th volume Curve was putting up. Finally, let’s jump into our profitability section starting an overview of the AMO holdings. We are down quite badly. The grand total of all AMOs dropped by over $150M. The Curve AMO dropped by 100M down to $606M, Liquidity $75M, lost $5M, Lending $79.9M lost $15M, and Investor 179M, lost 45M. It’s going to take us quite some time to regain all of these assets into the treasury. But Flywheel DeFi will be here every week reporting in on every step of the journey. Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. For the month of March, we have $670k in revenue and $890k in bribe expense, which means we are at a loss of $220k for March. We have a bribe payment coming up shortly so we will see higher losses for the month – with the market no longer in the echo bubble mode.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/speechless-fraxcheck-30
19,"DeFiDave sat down with Sam Kazemian at ETH Denver and had an expansive discussion on Frax and the future of the protocol. We broke down the highlights below.  The biggest event at ETH Denver was Sam's talk on Stablecoin Maximalism. In his view, everything is a stablecoin, a derivative of the original that must be maintained and developed. Frax is the premier stablecoin protocol and will continue to view the entire crypto ecosystem through the eyes of building stable products used across a variety of networks.  When thinking about money or stablecoins, the most important metric is the Monetary premium. This is the percentage of supply that is not earning yield and used for its own sake. For Frax, this is the amount of FrxETH not in either the Curve ETH/FrxETH LP or the sfrxETH vault. As more use cases emerge and various DeFi protocols and networks add support, the monetary premium should rise.  Infrastructure helps expand the Frax vision and Sam K knows which teams are long termed aligned. The Curve ecosystem is one of the most powerful and Sam K is “very grateful” for their work and how they have allowed Frax to grow.  Curve gives Frax pricing power, a social consensus to ensure stablecoins remain pegged to each other. While Uni-V3 is highly efficient, stablecoins want the best mint redeem function and that is a smooth invariant, and that’s found at Curve. As a stablecoin maximalist Sam K loves this mint/redeem function provided by Curve.  We all love being degens, but at some point, when a protocol or idea gains enough traction, you have to become more conservative to preserve the original ideas and vision. Now that Frax is a billion dollar protocol, he wants to ensure the safety of it as many people’s lives depend on it. There’s a lot of new products in the Frax' ecosystem, but none of them break the core dynamics of the stablecoin.  BAMM is an oracle-less lending product that both builds liquidity and lets people borrow liquidity as the asset rises. Frax is building it to increase the FRAX supply. The structure is brand new and is not limited by a matching lenders and borrowers. Anyone can borrow whatever side they want at any rate. It’s a generalized lending facility that potentially will massively increase demand for FRAX.  It’s nearly impossible to build a completely decentralized application that never requires any upgrades or improvements after launch. Only a few projects like Uniswap, Liquity and Tornado Cash have been able to do this grand feat. In reality, a team of people control a multi-sig which executes on-chain actions. It’s not a perfect solution. Frax is working to fully remove any threat from external actors by developing a new governance module, that would allow the DAO to vote down any multi-sig actions over a 24 hour period. This would fully remove the multi-sig from its position of power, instituting a check from veFXS holders. Expect to see news about this in the second half of the year.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/sam-kazemian-and-defi-daves-interview
20,"USDC redemptions will open on Monday morning USDC will remain redeemable 1 for 1 with the U.S. Dollar. Circle holds $5.4bn with BNY Mellon and $1bn with Customers Bank. There is zero exposure to Silvergate or Signature Bank, another potentially troubled crypto bank.  Even if there is a shortfall from SVB, Circle will make all depositors whole, as required by money transmitter laws.  Over the last 48 hours, the second largest banking failure in the US history has put the entire crypto industry on watch and also raised questions about the financial health of numerous other banks. And while Circle’s USDC represents a tiny percentage of the victims of this bank run, its loss of peg is representative of the wider threats to the entire economy from rapid interest rate rises due to inflation.  This story is one of money. Over the last 3 years since the start of the pandemic, the US money supply has expanded by 50% as the Federal government pumped trillions into the economy to fight Covid and the resulting supply chain issues. Inflation rose to the highest recorded levels since the 1970s after a decade of ultra low interest rates that spurred a monster of a bubble in tech, crypto, EVs, and more. Deploying capital into risk assets was the best option when money was cheap and yields were low.  In the past week, two banks have failed.  First, Silvergate Bank shuttered its doors after a long fight against closure. The embattled crypto bank bought billions of 10 year municipal tax free bonds at the peak of its capitalization. After the collapse of FTX, 3AC, and Luna, depositors withdrew 90% of their money from the bank, forcing Silvergate to sell its bond portfolio. While this normally is not an issue, interest rates doubled in a short period of time and Silvergate failed to hedge properly. The bank ended up realizing a loss of $1.2 bn, essentially wiping all of its profits earned since IPO. On a positive note though, Silvergate fulfilled all withdrawal requests from both insured and non-insured depositors.  SVB’s collapse started with the threat of a credit downgrade by Moody’s on Monday, March 6th. On Wednesday, March 8th, the company announced that it had sold $20bn of its liquid bond portfolio at a $1.8bn loss and would also sell $2.25 bn in new shares to bolster its balance sheet to fight the downgrade. Moody’s still downgraded the bank and panic ensued. A wave of high profile investors like Peter Theil and VC funds publicly advised their companies to pull all their funds from the bank. Over the next two days, SVB’s share price plunged another 60%. By Friday the damage was total, SIVB share trading was halted, the bank failed to find a buyout and California regulators intervened, shutting down the bank and placing it into receivership with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.  Success came with a price though, as SVB ended up with billions in excess deposits, nearly doubling in size from 20-21. The bank used the majority of those funds to buy long dated securities and expand their “Held-to-maturity” portfolio. In a weird accounting trick, HTM assets don’t have to be marked to market so long as the entire portfolio is held to term. This allows the bank to essentially hide short term losses from rate movements, which eventually disappear at the end of term.  Normally this is fine for banks. Their loan books and deposit base are diversified and so even when one sector is navigating troubled markets, the other sectors bouy up any weakness. SVB catered to a very specific sector of the economy that typically endures massive boom/bust cycles. If all of your clients are experiencing the same issues, funding, payrolls, raising capital, it aligns their fears and creates stress on the bank. SVB ultimately paid this price for its chosen exposure. A 50 year old bank and the 20th largest in the United States destroyed in 48 hours.  The chart above shows the total value of all banks that have collapsed since 2001. What’s stunning about the chart is the sheer size of the Silicon Valley Bank failure. It’s on the scale of WaMu during the Great Financial Crisis. Unlike then, SVB’s collapse was not a result of highly leverage bets on the US real estate market. Instead, it’s a treasuries crisis caused by the Federal Reserve.  Once the bank was closed, names started emerging of who kept cash on the banks balance sheet. Investors into Circle shared that the company had recently disclosed Silicon Valley bank was one of 6 depository institutions it kept cash at. CEO Jeremy Allaire previously had stated that Circle held most of its cash reserves Bank of New York Mellon, so a question lingered amongst analysts as to how much exposure Circle had to SVB. It took more than 24 hours for the stablecoin issuer to disclose that it held $3.3bn in uninsured deposit accounts.  The market immediately sold off USDC. Coinbase and Circle soon announced that redemptions were paused. In spectacular timing, it was the weekend, banks were closed and they didn’t have enough cash on hand to facilitate several billion dollars worth of redemptions. Overnight USDC fell to lows of $0.88 on some exchanges, recovering to $.95 as of publication.  Most analysts covering the bank failure have estimated recovering 70-80% of deposits. Circle most likely will lose a billion dollars of its reserves. If their reserve supplied stayed at $43bn where it was last week, the loss would be minimal as the company is earning 4% against $30bn in treasuries or several hundred million after expenses.  But the real threat is that investors are now spooked and will flee USDC for other safer assets. Circle will not lose much selling its short term treasuries, like Silvergate and SVB did. Assuming the $3.3bn stays illiquid for some time, if reserves drop to $20bn, it then would represent 16.5% (priced at $.84 per USDC ) of their portfolio. At $10bn it would be 33% ($0.77 per USDC). USDC is supposed to be fully liquid at all times. Any illiquidity will be priced in, as was seen overnight.  The big question now shifts to Monday, when banks reopen, Circle and Coinbase can process withdrawals and the FDIC announces how much it expects to return to depositors. In the best case scenario, the bank finds a buyer, uninsured depositors are returned 95%+ of their capital, and Congress finally decides to pass stablecoin legislation that would prevent this from happening again.  We’ve talked extensively about what stablecoins are here at Flywheel. USDC is not bank money and its deficiencies were acutely highlighted this past week. The Federal government has delayed Circle from becoming bank, where it could directly access credit with the Federal Reserve. Instead, it was forced to park its assets with several niche crypto banks that all are failing at a the same time. Contagion risks are high for other institutions supporting the tech sector and hopefully none of the other institutions Circle banks with will fail.  The failure of lawmakers and regulators to provide a legal way for Circle to ensure the safety of its deposits is a black mark that will have significant consequences for years to come. I would expect a shift in policy debates post-hoc as Democrats call for full shutdown of stablecoin issuers in the United States and Republicans are prevented from passing targeted legislation favoring the industry until the potentially win in the next election cycle.  Honestly, its weeks like this that remind us all why Bitcoin is around in the first place. Crypto has always thought of itself as a shield against the scourges of the banks. Where the back dealings of a shadowy banking cabal couldn’t spread into and cause crisis after crisis. For all of the questions around Bitcoin’s viability long term, it is completely non-reliant on well functioning banks and a dollar based money system.  A single bank blowing up doesn’t threaten Bitcoin, but it’s creating deep idealogical questions in the Ethereum community as to what power should be given to fiat backed stablecoins within DeFi and the ecosystem as a whole. In its current form, Circle and other stablecoin issuers will always be susceptible to custodial risk and bank runs. Ethereum and DeFi will continue to inherit these problems so long as the underlying asset is not bank money with access to the Fed. Frax Founder Sam Kazemian has long seen this day coming. Since the Luna collapse he has repeatedly stated that the only “safe” way to issue stablecoins is through a bank that has access to a Federal Reserve Master Account. We all need to have a long and hard discussion politically about how we issue and regulate stablecoins. Leaving private companies to navigate a grey zone legally only leads to loss of confidence in the product and potential bank runs.  It’s time we have a national conversation on stablecoins, how they are issued, who can custody them, how the collateral can be invested. I hope this is a wake up call for everyone in this industry. It’s time to enact new changes for the better.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/silvergate-silicon-valley-bank-usdc
21,"The best event outside the conference halls was the meetup hosted by Flywheel, Reserve, and Reflexer on Wednesday night. We distro’d some sick Frax-branded t-shirts and mingled with the brightest minds in DeFi. The real highlight of the week was the Milady Rave… The switch has been flipped and all of the earned FXS is going towards cvxFXS now. Yields are “high” to say the least… as of writing it was in the 50% range. Hopefully this is enough to bring cvxFXS back closer to the peg, which at its peak was more than 15% off. This week saw the addition of new collateral assets in Fraxlend. Based on a previous governance vote APE, LINK, LDO, UNI, AAVE, and MKR are all to be added to Fraxlend. Additionally they will receive Lending AMO support. APE was the biggest shock for the Telegram chat. However, some timely words put the issue to rest.  Mr. Hayes dropped a new article… Frax talked about this option 2 years ago: We love the Bankless team, but one slip from host David Hoffman about Lido receiving a Wells Notice sent the token sliding 7% on the day. The entire market is testy and looking for reasons too short, with multiple lawsuits having been started this past month. Some questions came up about Frax’s exposure (none), but the real chad Kmets left this comment:  Green Jeff dropped in the chat to announce the launch of msETH, a synthetic ETH generated using sfrxETH as collateral. This is the first synthetic product allowing wrapping of sFrxETH and we think it could be big. We’re excited to see how it grows.  One thing the Metronome team really dropped the ball on was the name…. so many Heisenberg memes lost forever.  Many stables have attempted to reach escape velocity via liquidity, maybe the winner is FRAX It took a few votes, but the Mstable rage quit proposal finally passed. Existing LPs can now exit out of their locks for a 20% fee. Based on some calculations in the group chat, the fees Frax would earn would be equal or greater than how much FXS was distributed to the pool.  Rage quits, while distasteful, are a necessary part of DAO life. I’d like to include this Ameen tweet as evidence:",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/this-week-in-frax-march-4th-10th
22,"Thanks for reading Flywheel DeFi! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support our work. The worst part is all of the no-coiners and other anti-crypto people dunking on Silvergate. Politicians such as Elizabeth Warren and Sherrod Brown made statements to the effect that Silvergate’s downfall was a result of FTX and a fraud that needed to be put out of business. Banks take in deposits from customers, they then invest that money into debt assets like treasuries and bonds. Normal banks typically buy a mixture of both short and long dated debt to maximize revenues. Banks make most of their money from this process. Normally this is all fine and well. Depositors come and go, but they don’t all run for the exit at once. We live in crypto land though, where constant boom and bust cycles endlessly produce and destroy capital. LUNA’s collapse wiped out a $60bn asset in a couple of days. FTX is dead and Sam’s going to jail for life for leaving a $8bn hole. These two events put the fear of Craig Wright into people who pulled billions of dollars out of the crypto markets in just a few months. Silvergate was no exception. In just a few months depositors pulled more than $8bn out of the bank, almost a 90% reduction. If Silvergate had other clients than crypto companies, they probably could have weathered the shock, but their exposure was total and so they were forced to sell all of the treasuries and bonds they had invested into. Unfortunately for Silvergate, while their services focused on crypto related activities, their investment portfolio did not reflect. Silvergate bought billions in long-duration municipal bonds and mortgage-backed securities (MBS) during the absolute lows of a 50 year bond bull run. Duration risk, the mismatch between short term deposits and long term debt, is one of the two main reasons banks and other financial institutions fail. If Silvergate had been through a few boom bust cycles with crypto they would have known the severity of capital destruction and draw down risk endemic to the industry. Rates were so low for so long that they had no option but to invest in long term debt instruments that didn’t match the risk appetite of their customers just so they could turn a profit and stay afloat. They were not prepared at all for the largest rate volatility event in decades caused by massive stimulus, Fed incompetence and supply chain implosion. Stablecoin issuer Circle, who operates much like a bank, was much better positioned for outflows. They keep their collateral in 20% cash and 80% in short term securities with an average duration of 3 months. Yes they make less money, but they are built with bank runs in mind. Silvergate wasn’t and suffered the ongoing consequences, most likely shuttering and filing for bankruptcy in a few days. Silvergate’s demise should be remembered by the industry not as a self-inflicted wound, but rather a sinister strike by the powers at hand. Regulators have had full insight into their banking practices, as the industry is one of the most highly regulated in the world. Their actions are a key attack on the movement of funds between all crypto institutions, as they hope to irrevocably harm the industry in the depths of this multi-year crash.  Alluring as it might be, Frax believes the risks of default, seizure, or duration vastly outweigh the yield gained off-chain. During the LUNA collapse, more than half of the FRAX supply was wiped out in a few weeks. Had Frax been fully invested in yield bearing assets, it too would have suffered the same fate as Silvergate potentially. Founder Sam Kazemian has made it clear that the only off-chain assets Frax will ever invest into will be through a Fed Master Account to access the risk free rate offered by banking with the US government itself. The hardest part for Frax is still yet ahead. Armed with a suite of stablecoins, Frax is going to use these lessons learned to pave a path of conservative growth and expansion using the most pristine collateral in existence.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/silvergate-bank-shows-why-frax-should
23,"Bitcoin is the “most pristine” crypto collateral on the planet…. But it’s terrible for anything else. DeFi, NFTs, etc, it’s just not made for “utility.” It’s digital native money.  Due to Bitcoin’s hardened and non-expressive code, it can’t communicate with other networks like newer L1s can. What this means is that any bridge/custody solution is going to have to rely on M-sigs at some level. Different projects use different strategies to protect the M-sigs, like with MPCs or simply a high number of signers, but ultimately, it’s a security flaw. This is probably why WBTC is so prolific and stands without competition from other decentralized options. It’s simply easier to trust a regulated private custodian, than placing trust in your code not to be hacked.  So what’s the best solution then? Well BadgerDAO thinks its to ditch this custody question altogether and instead rely on good ole staked ETH! Their newest product is eBTC, a synthetic Bitcoin product built with LSDs like Frax in mind. Badger describes eBTC as: eBTC is a collateralized crypto asset soft pegged to the price of Bitcoin and built on the Ethereum network. It is backed exclusively by Liquid Staked ETH (LSD) and powered by immutable smart contracts with no counterparty reliance. It’s designed to be the most decentralized synthetic BTC in DeFi and offers the ability for anyone in the world to borrow BTC at no cost. Fun is the first word that I think of after reading this. eBTC is a collateralized synthetic BTC, where the collateral, staked ETH, is highly correlated. Correlation can be between -1, 0 and 1. Over the last year, ETH/BTC has typically fallen in the .9 range for long periods of time, meaning that the two assets trade in near perfect movements to each other.  When borrowing assets, how correlated the two are directly affects the future probability of liquidation. The higher the correlation, the lower the risk of getting rekt, and vice versa. As a result of ETHBTCs super high correlation, the protocol can offer a much higher LTV ratio than other pairs like ETH-USDC. Maximum leverage will be much higher as a result.  Another cool aspect is that when you use ETH collateral to borrow eBTC, you now are short Bitcoin. This is such a cool prospect for those who believe in the Flippening, where the market cap of ETH becomes larger than BTC. eBTC will be collateralized by LSDs (FrxETH) and have no borrow, minting or closing debt fees. A percentage of the ETH yield will be repurposed to drive eBTC asset demand and incentives. Most likely they will use part of the yield to pay LPs. The BadgerDAO team has not released any specific info on this yet.  Watch the full interview with Chris (Spadaboom) to get all the alpha.

24,"Welcome to Frax Check. Your weekly frax vibe check. I am your host Kapital_K and I’m joined by my cohost DeFi Dave and our producer extraordinaire Sam. We will be going straight to the source of truth via checking the chain. Before we jump in, please subscribe to the flywheel, it really does help! Please also follow us @flywheeldefi on Twitter and tg. This week.. I call this week the “Same Same but Different” week. As the name suggests, this week things are about unchanged, maybe some small changes. Frax Check will now break up into two main sections: Product Lines and Profitability. As the name suggests, for the first section, we’re going to go through some of Frax’s products such as FRAX (the stablecoin), frxETH (the stablecoin), FraxBP, FraxLend, FraxSwap, you get the idea. Then we’ll investigate the Profitability across these products. We start with the flagship product: $FRAX stablecoin. We see the Supply has been holding steady at $1B-ish, unchanged from last week. Not much to update here. Then obvs, we must check the peg, which got as low as $0.995 with a high of $1.001 for the week. Peg Check = Strong. We then looked at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We received a 0.9984 exchange rate. This is 2 bps lower than last week. Nothing newsworthy this week so moving on we have our Collateralization %. This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. We’re unchanged at 92%. Following we have the Decentralize %, which saw a decrease of 80 bps and are now sitting at 23.9%.  For this week we saw the FraxBP TVL dropped to $521M, which is -1.6% decrease from last week – tvl has declined two weeks in a row down approximately 3% in 2 weeks. On the right side we have a new metric I wanted to start looking at which is the volume traded. For context, in February we hit 49.3M, and in first week of March we hit 21.9M already. Though, this is still only 4.2% utilization rate of the TVL. Following this slide, we have a yield and bribes section, where I look at the current yield being offered to LP into this pool and the bribes Frax Finance had to pay for the yield. You see here that there’s an APR of 1.7% for a $530M pool so the estimated $345k of yield for the 14-day epoch because Votium epochs are 14 days. Then we compare that to the bribes paid we see if there was any gain. This epoch so far, we paid $241k so rough back of the envelope math says we’re doing pretty good so far this month. However it’s important to note that Frax Finance’s POL isn’t the only liquidity in the pool so its reward shares are definitely diluted but that’s part of the plan as Frax wants to attract liquidity into the FraxBP. To that end, $733 of liquidity were incentivized by $1 of bribes paid. Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP. We’re at $72M, a decrease of 9% from last week. On the following slide, we’ll quickly cover some yields on these metapools as well as the bribes paid. Because there are quite a few stablepair metapools, I’m only looking at the top ones by TVL. The alUSD and FRAXBP pair is paying out 8.5% APR at nearly $46M in TVL. Honestly, still not too shabby if you believe/trust in alchemix’s mechanism and collateral set. On the bribes front, Frax paid $29.8k this epoch. And if we look at Liquidity per Bribe Dollar, Frax was able to pull in $2,416 per $1 of bribes spent. For the whole month Frax spent $29.8k and got $2,416 of liquidity per $1 bribe dollar spent. So, c’mon people, we got some yield and liquidity for your community, so come and get some! Any projects out there looking to work with the Metapool, please join the Flywheel TG chat and DM any of the hosts for assistance. Also one quick note, we also have an additional $19.7M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. That is decrease of 10% over last week. Similarly, I wanted to look at some of the yield and the bribes for these non-stable metapool pairs. For this category, I went the other route and sorted by APR. We see here that ALCX-FRAXBP pool is printing over 54% with $1.4M in TVL. What is interesting this week is that the usual suspect of cvxCRV, cvxFXS didn’t even make the top 4 list in terms of APR. On the bribes side, Frax paid $12.4k this epoch and incentivized over $1.5k in liquidity. So far this month, Frax paid $12.4k and the liquidity incented is $1,588 of liquidity per $1 of bribe spent. So, adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $91.7M of liquidity paired against FraxBP – down 9% this week. Pain. Next, we have our FrxETH segment. We start by checking the frxETH supply. As always, it’s up only! The count is at 112,126. And look at that chart, I know you can’t read it but just appreciate the verticalness off that graph. +6.6%. Hot. I do think we may slow down in percentage growth terms as we’re getting to size but I hope we don’t! Let’s look at where the frxETHs are hanging out! As a reminder, You can stake your frxETH into the sfrxETH vault to earn the native ETH staking yield. And in that vault we see that 57% of the frxETH is chilling and stacking ETH earning a nice native staking yield. The other place you can take your frxETH is to the curve pool of frxETH/ETH, where you can join 34% of the frxETH supply. The remainder 9% is floating in the ether somewhere. I think the yield parity between the sfrxETH and Curve pool is reflected in the current split. Unless Frax cranks up the bribes a bit more, I think we’ll see this heavier flow into sfrxETH. And also lets note that there’s 9% of frxETH just chilling, this number is increasing more and more these last few weeks. But enough talk of the supply and the yield, let’s get down to the peg. Peg check is ABOUT as strong as it could be, you see the price delta at 0.0001 between frxETH and ETH! But, we obvs have to go into the market and check this ourselves and you see here that I tried to swap a 3500 frxETH which is roughly the amount of the largest frxETH holder and I get an exchange rate of 0.9985 And also let’s just note the TVL here, we’re at $117M. Still 9 SOLID FIGURES baby. Peg check strong. Curve swap strong. Count up-only. Staked % healthy.  So far so good, let’s see how we stack up with the others. Here we layout the LSD market landscape. Obvs, we have Lido in the lead with 74.8% of the market. Frax REMAINED the highest 30-day delta in the group, at +30% so far. FrxETH’s market share is at 1.44%. Let’s keep fighting the good fight! On the yield landscape, frxETH pretty much dominates with a 6.3% and the closest competitor is Stakewise at 4.7%. We are the best game in town so come get some of this gud gud! Next we have a new section I added. Another one of Frax’s product that might not get as much as love as the other products is FPI. Quick refresher, FPI is a Frax Price Index, which is a stablecoin that tracks inflation. This is the first product of its kind on chain. So lets run through the numbahs! So far, we have 82.3M supply of FPI, current inflation reading is 6.3% and the FPI peg is ABOVE by 0.81% of its peg. And you’re wondering how it maintains its peg to inflation, well that’s what the treasury is for. For the record, FPI’s treasury is at $88M. Like how the AMOs work for Frax stablecoin’s treasury, the FPI’s treasury is made up of FPI, FRAX, and a small percentage holding of FXS. As you can see 85% of the treasury is in the FPI/FRAX convex, with another 10% just consisting of FPI & FRAX chilling in the Controller/Comptroller smart contracts. All these assets are put to work just like in the AMO to earn that needed yield to keep FPI at the inflation peg. Next we have our FraxLend section. We’ve snatched a TVL of $232M with $54M in borrowed FRAX. The charts I like to look at are the Collateral Value and the Supply Value. These are great proxies for trust in the product. A good confidence check and you see the graphs are trending up and to the right. Following that I like to check the utilization %, which for me is how much of the total supply has been borrowed, and we’re at 80% utilization rate across all the lending pairs. This is a slightly different way of looking at utilization rates, but I prefer it. Currently, there are many pairs being offered on FraxLend but more and more are being added. Also take a look at the current Supply APY for CRV/FRAX pair. A whopping 10.8%. then right behind it is the gOHM/Frax pair at 10.5%. Folks sure are degening hard into these two – maybe crvUSD is on the horizon. A little further down the list you see there’s the sfrxETH/FRAX pool with a juicy 7% APY. Be sure to listen to our Governance Roundup to get any alpha on any future pairs. The last leg of the Stablecoin Maximalism: the DEX aka FraxSwap. Per DeFi Llama, the TVL is $69M with a 23M monthly volume for March. I just took the Monthly volume divided by the TVL to get a utilization rate of 33%. Granted the volume this last 2 months have been picking up so if you look at December, the utilization rate could be in the 70%s for the lows, but that’s still pretty good. Now there is a slight discrepancy between DeFi Llama’s reported TVL and the one on Frax Facts but that’s because of the massive $85M FraxFPI pool that DeFi Llama isn’t including in the TVL. Finally, let’s jump into our profitability section starting an overview of the AMO holdings. We have a grand total of $1048M across all the AMOs. The Curve AMO is at 710M, Liquidity $80M, Lending $79.9M, and Investor 179M.  Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. For the month of March, we have $360k in revenue and $890k in bribe expense, which means we are at a loss of $530k for March. I think we definitely lucked out last month since the bribe payment fell into this first week of March instead of the last week of February. ~~~~ ~~~~ Listen to Flywheelpod Wherever You Listen to Podcasts: Spotify ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ Not financial or tax advice.

25,"Kazemian gave several examples of stablecoins that have this dual structure including USDC, stETH, frxETH, bridged DAI, and FRAX. So what happens to stablecoins that do not converge on this two-prong structure? Kazemian contends that those stablecoins will be unable to scale into the trillions. So far, there is no evidence of alternatives that can prove otherwise and over a long enough time period, those who fail to adopt this structure will lose market share to those who do embrace it. The strongest tangible measurement of a stablecoin’s network effect and value accrual is its monetary premium which surpasses brand name, reputation, and other traditional business metrics. The ability to issue currency with value in it of itself is an unforkable concept that is only achieved from years of building utility and trust. It is the reason why Tether is the de facto stablecoin for centralized exchanges, USDC is the most widely used stable in DeFi, and that FRAX and DAI have achieved billions in circulating supply. While stablecoins will evolve to have different pegs, their underlying structure will remain the same. The first era of stablecoins consisted of commonly accepted dollar-pegged ones such as Tether, USDC, FRAX, and DAI. The second era of stablecoins consisted of established DeFi primitives such as AMMs, lending markets, and veWrappers. The third era that we are currently in consists of liquid staking derivatives, bridges, and other protocol derived assets like GMX’s potential future stablecoin. One statement that Sam repeated throughout the speech is that Frax is extremely consistent on its stablecoin maximalist worldview. At the end of the day, Frax Finance is a stablecoin protocol that issues innovative decentralized stablecoins and builds the subprotocols to support them. Presently, this three stablecoins FRAX, FPI, and frxETH, supported by integrations in Fraxlend, Fraxswap, and Fraxferry. Stablecoins are one of the most important infrastructure pieces in all of crypto and everything Frax builds and ships is with the intention of achieving the highest monetary premium in the safest manner at scale. Through the protocol’s underlying philosophy of stablecoin maximalism, within 5-10 years, the Frax family of stablecoins aims to achieve hundreds of billions if not trillions of dollars in TVL. Whether you know it or not anon, at the end of the day, it’s all stablecoins.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/frax-finance-co-founder-sam-kazemian
26,"Slide 1 Hey everyone my name is David Liebowitz, better known as DeFi Dave, and I am here to talk to you about the wonderful world of stablecoin regulation. What to expect. And where we go from here. Slide 2 Slide 3-4 Make no mistake, there is a fierce debate going on in capitol hill about the future of crypto as an industry. Although more legislators than ever see crypto as a promising frontier, the challenge for the industry remains how can we reach across the aisle to the skeptics and come together in a way that will benefit the American economy and bring prosperity to the people. Fortunately, legislation for fiat-backed or commonly referred to as “payment stablecoins” has been proposed and offers a unique opportunity to bring clarity to the current clouded environment. Don’t take it from me.  According to Circle CEO Jeremy Allaire “Stablecoins are the lowest-hanging fruit… It’s the most straightforward. It’s a foundational piece.” Slide 5 Stablecoins are blockchain-based assets that are pegged to an arbitrary value and there is no denying it, dollar-pegged stablecoins in particular have proven to be the killer application of this technology. Ever since the first stablecoins were launched in 2014, stablecoins have grown to dominate the space in both use cases and conversation. Stablecoins play a vital role in maintaining healthy liquid markets for tokens, allowing users to frictionlessly interact with DeFi in the most efficient way possible. In many cases, transactions that would require days to settle in the real world happen in a matter of seconds. Payment stablecoins make up the vast majority of stablecoins in circulation but a growing minority of stablecoins are backed by crypto or even commodities. Furthermore, stablecoins have found purpose in being paid out in salaries, sent for remittances, and act as a hedge against inflation in unstable economies. In these cases, stablecoins are a lifeline to preserving wealth. Slide 6 Slide 7 Stablecoins are NOT cryptocurrencies. Stablecoins are NOT banks. Stablecoins ARE a completely novel form of money that uses a public blockchain ledger to facilitate transactions and keep track of balances. Stablecoins will require separate definitions, distinctions, and guidelines from their counterparts. So what exactly makes a stablecoin a stablecoin? Slide 8 The foundational core of stablecoins is the social contract between the stablecoin holder and stablecoin issuer; holders receive utility while issuers receive yield. Stablecoin holders are able to retreat to stability on-chain in a frictionless manner and redeem without worry. In exchange, stablecoin issuers earn yield from the underlying reserves but are responsible for being able to reward the cash equivalent of fiat upon request. For example, payment stablecoins allow issuers to earn yield from High Quality Liquid Assets and holders to redeem for fiat at any time. The entire business model of payment stablecoins is centered on being the fiat on/off ramp to the on-chain world. Slide 9 Slide 10 Stablecoins are fundamentally a new technology and require a new framework. Are there any frameworks that exist today that we can judge? Slide 11 Currently at the state level, the New York Department of Financial Services approves of payment stablecoins as a part of their crypto regulatory framework. What New York got right here is that you DO NOT need to be a depository institution to issue a stablecoin. Slide 12 Slide 13 Slide 14 Slide 15 First and foremost, the bill firmly designates payment stablecoins under the oversight of the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC) which regulates banks and authorizes the office to establish a new federal license specifically for payment stablecoin issuers and allow them to apply for Fed Master Accounts. Because payment stablecoins are under the jurisdiction of the OCC, it explicitly means that they are not securities abd new license officially puts on the books that payment stablecoin issuers do NOT have to be banks. This is an intentional part of the bill to prevent entrenched incumbents from being favored. It does not prevent depository institutions from issuing their own stablecoins, it just means that they won’t be artificially protected by a regulatory moat. The bill further goes into detail on what is required from issuers and what protections are granted to holders, both of which have been asked by industry participants for years. For issuers, the bill defines what a payment stablecoin is, the requirements for maintaining a payment stablecoin such as reserves being high quality liquid assets, redemption policies, and attestings of backing. Similar to the NYDFS, it requires stablecoin issuers to separate stablecoin deposits from regular banking activities so it doesn't pose a risk to the system. It is best to think of this separation as a 21st century stablecoin provision of the glass-steagall act but instead of commercial banking and investment banking activities being separated, it's arguably more conservative because issuers are barred from lending! For holders, the Stablecoin TRUST act provides clear protections for them such as clarifying that they would have priority in the event of an issuer’s insolvency. In addition, the bill makes it a point to prioritize privacy and treats stablecoins as the equivalent of cash. All transactions not involving an intermediary are exempted from the Bank Secrecy Act and do not need to be reported. Based. Slide 16 When it comes to rules and regulations, payment stablecoins are the first rubicon for both legislators and crypto to cross together. If major payment stablecoin legislation such as the TRUST act were to pass it would be heralded as a bipartisan victory, and both sides can brag about how they are protecting investors and fostering innovation. With the proper guidelines in place, a stablecoin renaissance would commence and will usher in a new era where crypto will be known for its utility rather than speculation. Slide 17 Slide 18 Slide 19 To review, private payment stablecoins have existed for some time yet it is the public ledger payment stablecoins that get scrutinized… interesting. If only payment stablecoins were grouped with PayPal, the rhetoric from regulators would be very different. Slide 20 Looking back on the last session of Congress, after the collapse of Terra, the trilateral negotiations led by Representives Maxine Waters and Patrick McHenry from the House along with the Treasury Department could not get a bill to committee. With the fall of FTX, it all sealed the deal for legislation not passing that session. Yet from their talks, a quote unquote “ugly baby” of a bill was drafted and could be something that is considered in the future. Slide 21 Slide 22 Emmer's biggest concern is that “Any digital version of the dollar must uphold our American values of privacy, individual sovereignty, and free market competitiveness. Anything less opens the door to the development of a dangerous surveillance tool.” One of the biggest hurdles would be noted critic of cryptocurrencies Sen. Sherrod Brown who is the chair of the banking committee. Any payment stablecoin legislation that hits the Senate floor would need to be marked up by him. But with the proper framing, I am hopeful. Slide 23 Slide 24 Stablecoins are a global phenomenon and if those seeking to regulate it into the ground have their way before its utility on a grand scale becomes obvious, it will have tremendous ripple effects for the years to come. Stablecoins are growing in use and have a real chance of becoming the dominant form of settlement in the future. If issuers are forced to be pushed offshore then it would be a cataclysmic setback for capital market formation in the US, which is also an area that the SEC is mandated to protect. That’s why we need legislators to act now to pass a sensible framework regarding payment stablecoins because even if they pass laws to overturn regulations that are stamped on the books, it will be too little too late. Forget a bill being an ugly baby because the baby will be dead on arrival. Thank you.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/stablecoin-regulation-something-to
27,"Frax Finance was initially a hybrid algorithmic stablecoin protocol that proved itself over several years of operation, but it came into the spotlight at the beginning of 2023 with its Liquid Staking Derivative (LSD) product frxETH. With the LSD narrative running rampant, Frax benefited as one of the clear winners due to its innovative two-token system. What frxETH illustrates is how Frax is ultimately a stablecoin protocol with the goals of increasing the monetary premium of its family of stablecoins (FRAX, frxETH, FPI). These stablecoins would be aided in adoption by Frax’s “holy trinity” of DeFi primitives such as Fraxswap and Fraxlend. Most recently, Frax voted to have its flagship stablecoin 100% collateralized, marking the end of an era of partial-collateralization. FRAX’s backing is primarily made up of its AMOs which put its idle USDC collateral to work. Currently, the largest AMO operating today is the Curve AMO which has hundreds of million of dollars in TVL. While the collateral ratio of FXS backing is determined by market forces, Frax’s AMO adjusts supply of FRAX to maintain price stability. This is akin to a central bank conducting open monetary operations for their economy. Frax uses a two-token model, frxETH and sfrxETH, to provide a unique LSD offering. frxETH acts as a stablecoin pegged to ETH and does not earn any yield, whereas sfrxETH receives all yield from staking. Frax’s governance token FXS uses Curve’s ve token lockup model, dubbed veFXS. Currently, 41.22% of the supply is locked up. Like Curve, FXS gauges can be bribed. However, current bribe amounts are negligible. veFXS holders are entitled to 100% of AMO revenue and frxETH revenue (not distributed at this time). The current yield for veFXS holder is 1.83% APR. This should increase sharply once Frax beings to distribute frxETH fees. Ethereum Shanghai upgrade will lead to more ETH staked with Frax and higher fees for the protocol. Lido’s ETH staking dominance threatens Ethereum’s security ecosystem and leads to users flocking to other LSD protocols. Frax’s core mission is to build stablecoins and will soon launch frxBTC. Frax plans to replace WETH with frxETH as the primary ETH pairing for LPs. When Frax starts distributing the 8% sfrxETH fees to veFXS holders, it will increase yields significantly. Let's look at a projection for LSD Protocols over the next 2 years. LSD P/S protocol projections in terms of ETH The highlighted P/S ratio for frxETH is a conservative estimate that frxETH might achieve. At the end of 2023 and 4% market share, Frax’s P/S ratio is 1/4 as compared to the current P/S ratio and a value much closer to its competitors. RocketPool has the best P/S due to its high market share and fees, but with Distributed Validator Technology (DVT) being added soon, it seems that the Rocketpool model of decentralized staking might become obsolete. With the potential catalyst mentioned, I am confident that Frax might even outperform the 2024 & 2025 conservative estimates as more products are built out using frxETH. LSD protocols received their fair share of attention during January, but the narrative was cut short due to AI and ZK narratives quickly gaining popularity. Due to the PvP market environment that we are in, LSD protocols were dumped for the next narrative making the rounds on Crypto Twitter. LDO, FXS & RPL underperformed the market during this time. Thus, this might be a good chance to accumulate FXS before the LSD narratives come back in full swing. As Shanghai approaches, all eyes will be on ETH and all of its LSD protocols as the direct beta for the event. Currently, many users are not staking ETH due to the lock-up and peg deviation of staked ETH. Only 14% ETH is staked, while other L1s have greater than 30% staked. With Lido dominating ~30% of the staked ETH supply, it will pose a potential risk that many Ethereum watches have flagged. So while frxETH is the highest-yielding LSD, it could be an attractive choice for many making the switch after Shanghai. The frxETH-ETH LP will be able to handle any outflows immediately after the upgrade, and should scale with future inflows (frxETH Minter). This in turn generates more fees for Frax from both staking and LPing. Frax being the primary stablecoin issuer for ETH and BTC is its biggest bullish factor as to why it will outperform ETH. To replace WETH, Frax will have to create trading pairs with frxETH and incentivise protocols to pair up with frxETH. Frax has the assets (CVX) and a strong reserve of Frax stablecoin that they can fall back on. Using the FRAXBP as ~$700M TVL or the Frax liquidity AMO can mint Frax based on the protocol collateralization ratio to create a flywheel as follows: Once frxETH gets paired with tokens, the above flywheel will play out, resulting in a net positive for the Frax ecosystem. Replacing WETH and WBTC is an extremely tough job, but the Frax team always delivers, as seen from their full suite of products. Betting on FXS is equivalent to betting on the DeFi ecosystem as a whole (FRAX, frxETH, Fraxswap, Fraxlend, Fraxferry (Bridge), FPI). All these products and primitives are part of the Frax ecosystem and will help expand its foothold to other networks. All in all, the main factor why FXS can outperform ETH is due to the attention from Shanghai upgrade and the broader LSD narrative. As frxETH accumulates more market share, Frax will have a healthy source of income, solidifying FXS as a revenue-generating token. —-------------------------------------------- Disclaimer: This is a guest post and does not represent the views or opinions of Flywheel DeFi Not financial or tax advice.

28,"Welcome to Frax Check. Your weekly frax vibe check. I am your host Kapital_K and I’m joined by my cohost DeFi Dave and our producer extraordinaire Sam. We will be going straight to the source of truth via checking the chain. Before we jump in, please subscribe to the flywheel, it really does help! Please also follow us @flywheeldefi on Twitter and tg. This week.. I call this week the “A Little Green” week. As the name suggests, this week things are green – for the most part. It feels good. Frax Check will now break up into two main sections: Product Lines and Profitability. As the name suggests, for the first section, we’re going to go through some of Frax’s products such as FRAX (the stablecoin), frxETH (the stablecoin), FraxBP, FraxLend, FraxSwap, you get the idea. Then we’ll investigate the Profitability across these products. We start with the flagship product: $FRAX stablecoin. We see the Supply has been holding steady at $1B-ish with a small bump of 70 bps for the past week. Not much to update here. Then obvs, we must check the peg, which got as low as $0.997 with a high of $1.001 for the week. Peg Check = Strong. We then looked at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We received a 0.9986 exchange rate. This is 2 bps lower than last week. Nothing newsworthy this week so moving on we have our Collateralization %. This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. We decreased by 30 bps to 92%. Following we have the Decentralize %, which saw an increase of 2.6% and are now sitting at 24.1%.  For this week we saw the FraxBP TVL dropped to $530.3M, which is -1.7% decrease from last week. On the right side we have a new metric I wanted to start looking at which is the volume traded. For context, in January we had 12.1M, and in February we hit 49.3M. Though, this is still only 9.3% of the TVL. Following this slide, we have a yield and bribes section, where I look at the current yield being offered to LP into this pool and the bribes Frax Finance had to pay for the yield. You see here that there’s an APR of 2.2% for a $530M pool so the estimated $450k of yield for the 14-day epoch because Votium epochs are 14 days. Then we compare that to the bribes paid we see if there was any gain. This epoch so far, we paid $271k so rough back of the envelope math says we’re doing pretty good so far this month. However it’s important to note that Frax Finance’s POL isn’t the only liquidity in the pool so its reward shares are definitely diluted but that’s part of the plan as Frax wants to attract liquidity into the FraxBP. To that end, $684 of liquidity were incentivized by $1 of bribes paid. For this month so far Frax spent $562k in bribes and incentivized $330 per $1 of bribes spent. Now, we march forward to my favorite section of the Frax Check. Ladies and gents, we are… drumroll…. STILL at 104% of the 3pool. The FraxBasedPool is $530.3M versus 3pool's $512.2M. Now, it wasn’t easy to get to the top but now we gotta stay at the top. Also note that Frax3CRV saw a massive drop in TVL of nearly $100M. Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP. We’re at $79M, a decrease of -1.4% from last week. On the following slide, we’ll quickly cover some yields on these metapools as well as the bribes paid. Because there are quite a few stablepair metapools, I’m only looking at the top ones by TVL. The alUSD and FRAXBP pair is paying out 8% APR at nearly $46M in TVL, this gained about $40M TVL since I talked about it in like 3 Frax Checks ago. I like that y’all are paying attention. Honestly, still not too shabby if you believe/trust in alchemix’s mechanism and collateral set. On the bribes front, Frax paid $40.5k this epoch. And if we look at Liquidity per Bribe Dollar, Frax was able to pull in $1,953 per $1 of bribes spent. For the whole month Frax spent $90k and got $880 of liquidity per $1 bribe dollar spent. So, c’mon people, we got some yield and liquidity for your community, so come and get some! Any projects out there looking to work with the Metapool, please join the Flywheel TG chat and DM any of the hosts for assistance. Also one quick note, we also have an additional $22M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. That is decrease of nearly 1% over last week. Similarly, I wanted to look at some of the yield and the bribes for these non-stable metapool pairs. For this category, I went the other route and sorted by APR. We see here that ALCX-FRAXBP pool is printing over 40% with $1.6M in TVL. What is interesting this week is that the usual suspect of cvxCRV, cvxFXS didn’t even make the top 4 list in terms of APR. On the bribes side, Frax paid $8.7k this epoch and incentivized over $2.5k in liquidity. So far this month, Frax paid $21.5k and the liquidity incented is $1,018 of liquidity per $1 of bribe spent. So, adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $101M of liquidity paired against FraxBP – down 1.3% this week. Next, we have our FrxETH segment. We start by checking the frxETH supply. As always, it’s up only! The count is at 105,175. And look at that chart, I know you can’t read it but just appreciate the verticalness off that graph. +4.2%. Hot. I do think we may slow down in percentage growth terms as we’re getting to size but I hope we don’t! Let’s look at where the frxETHs are hanging out! As a reminder, You can stake your frxETH into the sfrxETH vault to earn the native ETH staking yield. And in that vault we see that 56% of the frxETH is chilling and stacking ETH earning a nice 7.4% APR. The other place you can take your frxETH is to the curve pool of frxETH/ETH, where you can join 37% of the frxETH supply earning 7.7% APR in CVX, CRV, FXS. The remainder 7% is floating in the ether somewhere. I think the yield parity between the sfrxETH and Curve pool is reflected in the current split. Unless Frax cranks up the bribes a bit more, I think we’ll see this heavier flow into sfrxETH. And also lets note that there’s 7% of frxETH just chilling. But enough talk of the supply and the yield, let’s get down to the peg. Peg check is as strong as it could be, you see the price delta at 0.0000 between frxETH and ETH. So parity! But, we obvs have to go into the market and check this ourselves and you see here that I tried to swap a 3500 frxETH which is roughly the amount of the largest frxETH holder and I get an exchange rate of 0.9984. And also let’s just note the TVL here, we’re at $126M. Still 9 SOLID FIGURES baby. So far so good, let’s see how we stack up with the others. Here we layout the LSD market landscape. Obvs, we have Lido in the lead with 74.5% of the market. This week we saw a massive deposit from Justin Sun, adding 150k of ETH to Lido. But you can see here that Frax REMAINED the highest 30-day delta in the group, at +33% so far. FrxETH’s market share is at 1.41%. Let’s keep fighting the good fight! On the yield landscape, frxETH pretty much dominates with a 7.7% and the closest competitor is Stakewise at 5.0%. We are the best game in town so come get some of this gud gud! Peg check strong. Curve swap strong. Count up-only. Staked % healthy. Next we have a new section I added. Another one of Frax’s product that might not get as much as love as the other products is FPI. Quick refresher, FPI is a Frax Price Index, which is a stablecoin that tracks inflation. This is the first product of its kind on chain. So lets run through the numbahs! So far, we have 82.3M supply of FPI, current inflation reading (since Dec 2022) is 6.3% and the FPI peg is ABOVE by 0.81% of its peg. And you’re wondering how it maintains its peg to inflation, well that’s what the treasury is for. For the record, FPI’s treasury is at $87.9M. Like how the AMOs work for Frax stablecoin’s treasury, the FPI’s treasury is made up of FPI, FRAX, and a small percentage holding of FXS. As you can see 85% of the treasury is in the FPI/FRAX convex, with another 10% just consisting of FPI & FRAX chilling in the Controller/Comptroller smart contracts. All these assets are put to work just like in the AMO to earn that needed yield to keep FPI at the inflation peg. Next we have our FraxLend section. We’ve snatched a TVL of $242M with $53M in borrowed FRAX. The charts I like to look at are the Collateral Value and the Supply Value. These are great proxies for trust in the product. A good confidence check and you see the graphs are trending up and to the right. Following that I like to check the utilization %, which for me is how much of the total supply has been borrowed, and we’re at 77% utilization rate across all the lending pairs. This is a slightly different way of looking at utilization rates, but I prefer it. Currently, there are many pairs being offered on FraxLend but more and more are being added. Also take a look at the current Supply APY for CRV/FRAXpair. A whopping 7.8%. Be sure to listen to our Governance Roundup to get any alpha on any future pairs. A little further down the list you see there’s the sfrxETH/FRAX pool with a juicy 7% APY. The last leg of the DeFi Trinity: the DEX aka FraxSwap. Per DeFi Llama, the TVL is $72.5M with a 255M monthly volume for February. I just took the Monthly volume divided by the TVL to get a utilization rate of 351%. Granted the volume this past month has been picking up so if you look at December theutilization rate could be in the 70%s for the lows, but that’s still pretty good. Now there is a slight discrepancy between DeFi Llama’s reported TVL and the one on Frax Facts but that’s because of the massive $85M FraxFPI pool that DeFi Llama isn’t including in the TVL. Finally, let’s jump into our profitability section starting an overview of the AMO holdings. We have a grand total of $1050M across all the AMOs. The Curve AMO is at 710M, Liquidity $83M, Lending $79.9M, and Investor 180M.  Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. For the month of February, we have $1.74M in revenue and $1.65M in bribe expense, which means WE ARE A LITTLE GREEN, profit of $81k for February. First time we’re in the green since No Profit November last year. ~~~~ ~~~~ Listen to Flywheelpod Wherever You Listen to Podcasts: Spotify ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ Not financial or tax advice.

29,"With the launch of veFPIS, we asked Frax founder Sam Kazemian his thoughts on FPI and what it means for the Frax ecosystem. Below is the interview with Sam K: Q.) In the simplest terms, what is FPI? Why is it significant? A.) FPI is the first decentralized stablecoin to be pegged to a basket of consumer items and aims to be a useful unit of account onchain that's not a national currency unit. Q.) How does FPI fit in the Frax eco? How does FPIS accrue value? A.) FPI is the most ambitious part of the Frax ecosystem because we see it as the successor peg to USD stablecoins in the entire crypto industry. The vision is that a couple years into the future FPI will be what a lot of DAOs, users, and projects save their assets in and price costs in. That is as large, if not larger, potential than another dollar pegged stablecoin. FPIS accrues value as the main gov token. A.) Yes, definitely. We think that the CPI peg weights and items can and will be voted on by veFPIS holders through onchain governance in the long term. Q.) As FPI increases in circulation, how will yield keep up with targeted inflation over time? A.) That's the most challenging part of the protocol. We have some unique mechanisms and yield opportunities but overall FPI adoption is easy, the peg is not. Thus, there is a mint cap to FPI that means more FPI cannot be minted past the limit the protocol can keep the CPI peg. Demand is very strong for FPI so at the beginning there needs to be a mint cap. Q.) How do you plan to decentralize FPI governance overtime? a.) veFPIS is the primary way governance will take place. There will be onchain votes on the CPI peg and weights similar to a gauge vote but with CPI baskets. Q.) In the same way FPI is a stablecoin is built on top of FXS/frax ecosystem, is it possible in the future for Stablecoins to be deployed permissionlessly in a similar manner erc-20th tokens are deployed on ETH? A.) We don't have plans for this and focus on stablecoins that are crucial to the Frax vision which is FRAX, FPI, frxETH, and possibly frxBTC.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/fpi-q-and-a-with-sam-kazemian
30,"The middle child of Frax stablecoins, (FPI & FPIS) launched its value accrual and governance system veFPIS this week. The rollout was extremely smooth and went off without any major issues. As of writing this article, 5 mil FPIS or 34% of supply has been locked for an average of 1.69 years. Even with 50% of the total airdrop amount being locked, the yields for veFPIS are well above 180%. With more than 200k USD worth of rewards distributed each week, veFPIS is undoubtedly the most slept on product in crypto right now. We’re really excited to see its growth and increased yield derived from excess FCR profits.   In a move which was controversially, but entirely expected, the Frax DAO has voted to increase the Collateralization Ratio of Frax to 100%. The proposal, put forward by Hameed, makes the following changes to the protocol:  Frax retires the decollateralize function. No FXS minted to achieve the target.  Retains protocol revenues to increase CR, pauses FXS buybacks Authorizes up to $3m per month in FrxETH purchases  I. Increase the target collateral ratio to 100%. This is the long-term target of the protocol and will require time to reach. No FXS will be minted to achieve this target. As part of this change, the protocol is retiring the algorithmic backing of FRAX and the decollateralize function. II. Retain protocol revenue to fund the increased CR, including pausing FXS buybacks. veFXS yield remains the same. III. Authorize up to $3m per month in frxETH purchases to increase the CR.  At the end of the day, the protocol will still function as it always has. What will be lost is AMO capital efficiency. Without the addition of FrxETH, this change probably would have been less palatable, as it would have drastically reduced revenues and weakened the overall long term health of the project. With the massive bump in revenue from FrxETH expected, closing a $90m gap to 100% CR is no longer detrimental and is instead beneficial to the overall health of Frax.  Metronome is a multi-collateral, multi-synthetic platform that creates new opportunities for yield and leveraged. Their newest product msETH, is a loan asset taken against sFrxETH to gain additional leverage. By “looping” debt from the collateral, high levels of leverage can be achieved against a highly correlated asset.  Metronome is asking for 4 voting cycles worth of CVX totaling 165,000 stake. The vote ends tomorrow and yet to achieve quorum. Check out the video in this week Frax In Review, Dave and Kiet were a little unsure about how the proposal would work, specifically the AMO’s. Sam walked them through how the Balancer BB pools work and what this would mean for Frax.  If you don’t succeed try, try, try again until you can’t propose anymore. Just this week, the most recent ragequit pool was hammered down now by the DAO. mStable is shutting down, but collateral is at risk. Should we allow users to unlock with a penalty? So far the answer has been no. However, we might just see how deep of a discount.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/this-week-in-frax-february-18-24th
31,"Sreeram told us in the interview that Eigenlayer will unlock “radical innovation” by allowing anyone to borrow the security guarantees of Ethereum. Referring to what we wrote in our previous article:  Eigenlayer is a way by which Ethereum stakers can provide other services like oracles, data storage networks, new consensus protocols, and multi-party computation. Today, to secure these systems, you have to spin up a new set of validators or a new trust network, and it is very expensive to bootstrap this. The limitations of these systems, which EigenLayer calls actively validated services (“AVS”), are “are either secured by their own native token, or are permissioned in nature.” Four negative consequences stem from the current AVS regime: Ultimately with EigenLayer solves the issues plagued by the current AVS setup with the following solutions: Solves bootstrapping problem for a new AVS by leveraging the large validator set of Ethereum. The capital cost of restaking ETH on EigenLayer is minimal, which helps to amortize the cost of staking capital. Improves trust aggregation by restaking a larger pool of capital and massively increasing the cost of corruption. Provides additional revenue streams to ETH stakers and consolidates the ecosystem's network effects due to the presence of a highly secure AVS ecosystem. With Eigenlayer, there will be several forms of staking. In the interview we primarily discussed restaking of staked ETH either directly from self-managed validators or, alternatively, LSDs like FrxETH or stETH. But this will not be the only way to stake into Eigenlayer. Another type called Superfluid Staking allows for LP tokens to be used as “collateral,” meaning that in theory any asset paired with ETH or FrxETH could be used. This opens up a ton of possibilities (and potentially gauges) that could be added in the future. If any FrxETH based pair can be used as staking collateral in EigenLayer, it could open up a vast new set of yield opportunities outside of just DeFi.  In the article he proposed the following: Create new ERC-4262 vaults (for example, esFrxETH) for those who want to participate in EigenLayer validators. More research needs to be done in how to safely and effectively manage this part of the stack but this will offer stakers optionality that would not exist with any other LSD. Develop a governance process in deciding which EigenLayer clients to support. Since it is an open market of networks to choose from, the Frax community can decide which ones to secure. This can be similar to how gauges are decided. Since every network is different, FrxETH can develop a methodology of tranches for each network that is supported, allowing stakers to optimize for yield and risk management. This proposal was written before our interview and also the publication of this whitepaper. Given this additional information, we can make a few changes to Dave’s ideas. First, Frax should pursue a role as a primary operator of EigenLayer, allowing for sFrxETH to be restaked through the main website with a new UI. Frax should conduct an analysis of the fee market once EigenLayer is launched and determine what costs and fees.  Third, the Frax DAO could vote to opt-in their entire sFrxETH holdings to validate new AVS instead of using a new ERC-4262 vault. If this was the case, individual voting could be assumed by veFXS on a week to week basis.  Fourth, Liquidity provision through EigenLayer could be integrated with the gauge system, where liquidity could be both locked and earn both Frax, Convex, Curve, and EigenLayer incentives all at once. A true expansion of the flywheel.  There are a ton of possibilities the Frax DAO can explore over the next few quarters as EigenLayer is launched and the initial AVS’s come online. Frax is well suited to lend its security and also enable new income streams from new EigenLayer services. This really could be the next gold rush for Ethereum.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/eigenlayer-releases-its-long-awaited
32,"In this week’s episode we had on DeFi Cheetah, who we happened across on Twitter a few weeks back when he wrote some awesome threads on Frax. One thing we liked about Cheetah was that he knows his stuff. As a former TradFi guy, he understands financial products, what the risks are, and how to describe them.  The thread that brought us to DeFi Cheetah was this great description why Frax should have some protection against regulators if ever Circle would come after the treasury. As the majority of all funds held by Frax are used in the Curve AMO, if Circle was ordered to freeze Frax’s USDC, everyone, including innocent people, would be affected. This makes Frax more resilient and also is where we get the phrase “Frax is backed by DeFi.” Another great thread that we loved was about how Curve will eventually beat out Uniswap due to its tokenomics. Curve by design creates a non-competitive marketplace due to veCRV locks. Since LPs can get a boost, they tend to keep all their liquidity in one place on Curve. Additionally, Curve fully embraces bribes, which only increases liquidity. So while CRV emissions are a cost, the fees and bribes pre-pay it. Last, LP management on Curve is easy, while on Uniswap it continues to move towards professionalization. But retail LP is what made DeFi in the first place. Long Live Curve. If you aren’t already following DeFi Cheetah, make sure to add him to your list of big brain threadoors who are always pushing the narrative in DeFi. We love to see his support for the Frax ecosystem and will definitely be watching his threads closely.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/why-frax-and-curve-are-inevitable
33,"Welcome to Frax Check. Your weekly frax vibe check. I am your host Kapital_K and I’m joined by my cohost DeFi Dave and our producer extraordinaire Sam. We will be going straight to the source of truth via checking the chain. Before we jump in, please subscribe to the flywheel, it really does help! Please also follow us @flywheeldefi on Twitter and tg. This week.. I call this week the “UP ONLY (mostly)” week. As the name suggests, this week things are bumping upwards. It feels good. Frax Check will now break up into two main sections: Product Lines and Profitability. As the name suggests, for the first section, we’re going to go through some of Frax’s products such as FRAX (the stablecoin), frxETH (the stablecoin), FraxBP, FraxLend, FraxSwap, you get the idea. Then we’ll investigate the Profitability across these products. We start with the flagship product: $FRAX stablecoin. We see the Supply has been holding steady at $1B-ish for the past month or so. Not much to update here. Then obvs, we must check the peg, which got as low as $0.998 with a high of $1.003 for the week. Peg Check = Strong. We then looked at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We received a 0.9988 exchange rate. This is 4 bps increase over last week. Nothing newsworthy this week so moving on we have our Collateralization %. This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. We remained unchanged for the week still at 92.3%, slight 30bps movement over the last 8 Frax Checks. Following we have the Decentralize %. Pretty much unchanged at 23.5%. Still V v v v much bear market vibes across the board when it comes to these two metrics. The Frax team has a goal to get it to one hunnid! But some members of the community wants to see the Collat % going back to the low 80s and the Decent % going back to 30s. Okay. Quick summary Health Check. Peg Good. Curve Swap unchanged Collat % could be better been stagnant. Decent % may be in a reversal to the upside. Next, we have the FraxBP product, which imo is sort of like liquidity as a service. For this week we saw the FraxBP TVL got to $539.4M, which is 1.7% increase from last week. On the right side we have a new metric I wanted to start looking at which is the volume traded. For context, in January we had 12.1M, and in February we hit 40.0M already. Though, this is still only 7.4% of the TVL. Following this slide, we have a yield and bribes section, where I look at the current yield being offered to LP into this pool and the bribes Frax Finance had to pay for the yield. You see here that there’s an APR of 2.66% for a $539M pool so the estimated $550k of yield for the 14-day epoch because Votium epochs are 14 days. Then we compare that to the bribes paid we see if there was any net gain on the bribes. This epoch so far, we paid $271k so rough back of the envelope math says we’re doing pretty good so far this month. However it’s important to note that Frax Finance’s POL isn’t the only liquidity in the pool so its reward shares are definitely diluted but that’s part of the plan as Frax wants to attract liquidity into the FraxBP. To that end, $731 of liquidity were incentivized by $1 of bribes paid.  Now, we march forward to my favorite section of the Frax Check. Ladies and gents, we are… drumroll…. at 104% of the 3pool. Queue DJ Khaled’s All We Do Is Win music! UP ONLY. The FraxBasedPool is $539.4M versus 3pool's $519.4M. What’s noteworthy is that the FraxBP didn’t gain that much TVL but 3pool lost over $20M. Note that we are now way above the Frax3CRV pool!!! Now, it wasn’t easy to get to the top but now we gotta stay at the top. Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP. We’re at $80M, an increase of 4% from last week. On the following slide, we’ll quickly cover some yields on these metapools as well as the bribes paid. Because there are quite a few stablepair metapools, I’m only looking at the top ones by TVL. The alUSD and FRAXBP pair is paying out 7% APR at nearly $47M in TVL, this gained about $30M TVL since I talked about it last week. I like that y’all are paying attention. Honestly, still not too shabby if you believe/trust in alchemix’s mechanism and collateral set. Another thing is that BUSD basically dropped off the map with a drop of basically 90% of its TVL. If you’re a CZ fan and binance believer, could be a good chance to get some outsized APR. On the bribes front, Frax paid $40.5k this epoch. And if we look at Liquidity per Bribe Dollar, Frax was able to pull in $2,005 per $1 of bribes spent. For the whole month Frax spent $90k and got $892 of liquidity per $1 bribe dollar spent. So, c’mon people, we got some yield and liquidity for your community, so come and get some! Any projects out there looking to work with the Metapool, please join the Flywheel TG chat and DM any of the hosts for assistance. Also one quick note, we also have an additional $22M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. That is a pop of 38% over last week. UP ONLY baby! Similarly, I wanted to look at some of the yield and the bribes for these non-stable metapool pairs. For this category, I went the other route and sorted by APR. We see here that OHM-FRAXBP is offering a whopping 38% APR! Wooh! That’s at least 3 weeks of that 35%+ APRs and OHM been pretty stable (but maybe you don’t want that in this echo bubble we got here) Then we have the usual flywheel suspects of CVX, cvxCRV, and cvxFXS at a range between 20 - 30%. Alcx/FraxBP is also paying a nice 36%. On the bribes side, Frax paid $8.7k this epoch and incentivized over $2.5k in liquidity. So far this month, Frax paid $21.5k and the liquidity incented is $1,028 of liquidity per $1 of bribe spent. So, adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $102.3M of liquidity paired against FraxBP – up 10% this week. And we broke the 9 figure club again baby! UP ONLY! Next, we have our FrxETH segment. We start by checking the frxETH supply. As always, it’s up only! The count is at 100,967. And look at that chart, I know you can’t read it but just appreciate the verticalness off that graph. +6.3%. Hot. I do think we may slow down in percentage growth terms as we’re getting to size but I hope we don’t! Let’s look at where the frxETHs are hanging out! As a reminder, You can stake your frxETH into the sfrxETH vault to earn the native ETH staking yield. And in that vault we see that 53.2% of the frxETH is chilling and stacking ETH earning a nice 7.4% APR. The other place you can take your frxETH is to the curve pool of frxETH/ETH, where you can join 42% of the frxETH supply earning 7.7% APR in CVX, CRV, FXS. The remainder 5% is floating in the ether somewhere. I think the yield parity between the sfrxETH and Curve pool is reflected in the current split. Unless Frax cranks up the bribes a bit more, I think we’ll see this heavier flow into sfrxETH. And also lets note that there’s 5% of frxETH just chilling. But enough talk of the supply and the yield, let’s get down to the peg. Peg check is pretty much as strong as it could be, you see the price delta at 0.0001 between frxETH and ETH. UP ONLY! But, we obvs have to go into the market and check this ourselves and you see here that I tried to swap a 3500 frxETH which is roughly the amount of the largest frxETH holder and I get an exchange rate of 0.9984. And also let’s just note the TVL here, we’re at $140M. Still 9 SOLID FIGURES baby. So far so good, let’s see how we stack up with the others. Here we layout the LSD market landscape. Obvs, we have Lido in the lead with 73% of the market but you can see here that Frax REMAINED the highest 30-day delta in the group, at +46% so far. FrxETH’s market share is at 1.43%. We’ve official flipped Stakewise. I did some dirty math and if we keep up this monthly growth and Rocketpool keeps up their growth, we’ll flip Rocketpool in 4 months-ish. Let’s keep fighting the good fight! On the yield landscape, frxETH pretty much dominates with a 7.4% and the closest competitor is Stakewise at 5.2 %. We are the best game in town so come get some of this gud gud! Next we have a new section I added. Another one of Frax’s product that might not get as much as love as the other products is FPI. Quick refresher, FPI is a Frax Price Index, which is a stablecoin that tracks inflation. This is the first product of its kind on chain. So lets run through the numbahs!

We’ve snatched a TVL of $261M with $52M in borrowed FRAX. The charts I like to look at are the Collateral Value and the Supply Value. These are great proxies for trust in the product. A good confidence check and you see the graphs are trending up and to the right.

Also take a look at the current Supply APY for gOHM/FRAXpair. A whopping 8%. Be sure to listen to our Governance Roundup to get any alpha on any future pairs. A little further down the list you see there’s the sfrxETH/FRAX pool with a respectable 6% APY. The last leg of the DeFi Trinity: the DEX aka FraxSwap. Per DeFi Llama, the TVL is $73M with a 209M monthly volume so far for February. I just took the Monthly volume divided by the TVL to get a utilization rate of 285%. Granted the volume this past month has been picking up so if you look at December, which looks to be about a third so utilization rate could be in the 70%s, but that’s still pretty good. In February so far, we’ve passed January’s volume and its only the 3/4 way through February. Now there is a slight discrepancy between DeFi Llama’s reported TVL and the one on Frax Facts but that’s because of the massive $85M FraxFPI pool that DeFi Llama isn’t including in the TVL. Finally, let’s jump into our profitability section starting an overview of the AMO holdings. We have a grand total of $1046.1M across all the AMOs. This was a $6M change over last week with $3M going to the Investor AMO and $3M going into the Liquidity AMO. The Curve AMO is at 710M, Liquidity $83M, Lending $71M, and Investor 183M.  Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. For the month of February so far, we have $1.26M in revenue and $1.84M in bribe expense. As you can see, most of our revenue comes from CRV rewards, magnitudes larger than the CVX and FXS rewards. With a net loss of $580k to start our month. We have a long way to climb to get over this profitability hurdle but it’s growth time so we gotta pay to play.  ",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/u-pee-oh-fraxcheck-27
34,"Most people escape inflation by investing in assets like stocks, bonds, real estate and crypto. The idea is that cash is always a losing game, so it's better to invest into productive investment assets which can either match or outpace inflation. The problem with money though is that once it gets minted, someone has to hold it until it's retired out of circulation.So you are always going to have cash on hand and need to spend it before it loses value. Inflation is the rate at which the general level of prices for goods and services is rising, and subsequently, the purchasing power of currency is falling. Consumer Price Index (CPI) is a measure of the average change over time in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. CPI is used as a benchmark to assess the overall inflation rate of an economy. The CPI includes a wide range of products such as food, housing, transportation, and medical care, and is calculated by measuring price changes for a particular basket of goods and services over a period of time. Escaping the effects of inflation is important because it can erode the value of savings and investments over time. Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money, so the same amount of money can buy fewer goods and services as time passes. This can make it harder for people to meet their financial goals, such as saving for retirement or paying for education. By escaping the effects of inflation, people can help preserve the value of their savings and investments and maintain their ability to meet their financial goals over time. Frax Price Index is an inflation pegged or inflation resistant stablecoin pegged to a basket of real-world consumer items as defined by the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The goal of FPI is to maintain its price to the CPI, and therefore its purchasing power, using on-chain stability mechanics and market operations. So instead of keeping your cash in a savings account, you could alternatively keep it in FPI with the understanding that the inflation protection comes with a different set of risks. Frax Price Index Share (FPIS) is the governance token of FPI and its used for three purposes in the FPI system. FPIS is the backstop for FPI. If ever on-chain yields are not high enough to support the peg and if the treasury runs out of excess capital, Frax protocol will sell FPIS to ensure the product stays solvent. The core profitability assumption of FPIS is that the yield the protocol earns will always be higher on average than increases in inflation. So far that has been true, but as FPI grows from the millions to the billions, it will become more difficult to find sustainable yields on-chain. FPIS captures all excess profits earned from yield on the collateral above the Frax Collateral Ratio (FCR). The FCR is the ratio of FRAX stablecoins directly backing FPI tokens. For example, if the FCR is 5% and there is 100m in collateral backing FPI, a surplus of 5m FRAX would need to be generated before any excess profits could be distributed to veFPIS stakers. Eventually, the CPI figures taken from the Chainlink oracle will be replaced with on-chain voting by veFPIS stakers. This is one of the more important parts about the new veFPIS contracts, as locked stakers will ultimately decide what the “real” inflation rate is. To prevent malicious voting, the contract has a slashing function built in to penalize stakes. It’s an economic way to prevent the protocol from paying out too much or too little to CPI. This new ve-contract has some upgrades that the original Curve and FXS contracts do not have. veFPIS has a ""’DeFi whitelist’"" for smart contracts that add modular functionality to the staking system.” This will allow for third party integrations of veFPIS that can spend a user's tokens, but at the same time keep the stake locked until the end date. One of the biggest issues with the original ve contracts was that all of the locked capital becomes illiquid and inaccessible to all DeFi products. This is why protocols like Convex appeared in the first place, so that users could access liquidity for their 4 year stakes. FPIS has the following tokenomics and supply distribution: 10% Airdropped to veFXS back in Feb 2022 10% set aside for veFPIS emissions, starting at 5mil a year and halvening each year. 30% to the treasury and controlled by veFXS 25% to FPI protocol treasury 25% to the Core Developers & Contributors Treasury The total supply of FPIS is 100m and no more tokens can be minted except to maintain the FPI peg to the CPI rate and keep the CR constant at 100%. One of our favorite things about FPI is that it has a fully transparent balance sheet that updates every minute. There is no other protocol or company with such financial statements as Frax produces. Since all the data is on-chain, exact profitability figures are continuously updated.  As of writing this article, there is more than $5m in excess value that has accrued to FPI. Additionally, FPI has been very profitable as well, making on average $100k a month. In just February alone, FPI has generated an excess profit of $72,052. veFPIS page FPI doc",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/frax-launches-vefpis-staking-and
35,"We’re changing the name of Frax in Review to This Week in Frax. Additionally, we’re also moving the day it goes out from Monday to Fridays, as a way to wrap up the week.  Is there better way to announce the details of a new Frax product than to post some googlely eyes in the main Telegram chat on the evening of Valentine’s Day? We think not <3 Travis dropped a link to the shiny new and updated veFPIS docs. We’re going to cover the entire ecosystem is detail on Monday, but here is the juiciest info. A new term was introduced “Frax Collateral Ratio” (FCR), which is the required ratio of collateral needed to fund FPI. Anything in excess should go to veFPIS stakers. More will be released about this soon. 10 mil FPIS is allocated to veFPIS rewards, it starts with 5 million and then follows a halvening cycle in perpetuity. veFXS gets control over 25% of the FPIS, which should keep it in check for the long term. Also, while writing this article, Travis dropped the following screenshot of the veFPIS dashboard. We’re also adding a new Governance Recap to FIR. Instead of pairing it with Fraxcheck, we will be discussing governance on Fridays. Welp, it’s been a fun 2 years of capital efficiency. Frax launched with the idea of building the most capital efficient, partially collateralized, algorithmic stablecoin. The idea behind it was that the market would figure out what the most optimal level of collateral would be required to maintain the peg. The CR bottomed out at 82% in Oct 2021, and has risen to 92% where its been stuck at since the beginning of the year. When Luna/UST crashed, it showed that market participants are playing Bloodsport and will do anything to try and destroy a protocol’s peg to profit. While Luna only had around 6% reserves when it crashed, the effect on the market and its participants was profound enough to drive a political change to bring the CR to 100%. Over the past year, Sam K has said multiple times that CR 100% is needed and inevitable. To harden the protocol against any attacks, market drive or regulatory, each Frax should and will always be backed by 100% or more of collateral. In an expansive gov proposal, Fraximalist Hameed recommended that we move to 100% CR in the following way: Increase the target collateral ratio to 100%. This is the long-term target of the protocol and will require time to reach. No FXS will be minted to achieve this target. As part of this change, the protocol is retiring the algorithmic backing of FRAX and the decollateralize function. Retain protocol revenue to fund the increased CR, including pausing FXS buybacks. veFXS yield remains the same. Authorize up to $3m per month in frxETH purchases to increase the CR. The biggest driver of this change would be redirecting protocol profits from FXS buybacks to purchasing FrxETH. Given the 8% gap at the moment, it would take around 30 months or 2.5 years to achieve 100% CR. While this might sound conservative, 90m is a large sum. If passed, which we think this proposal will, it would change the dynamics for veFXS for a temporary period. While FXS buybacks might be paused, the increased treasury base of FrxETH will provide additional resilience, protocol profits, and AMO expansion. So while the veFXS yield might decline as a result, the overall health of the protocol would increase, and should negate any negative side effects. The GS team dropped a proposal to create a FrxETH/Frax pool in GammaSwap. This would incentivize Sushi LPs to deposit tokens to GS to earn both protocol yield and gauge rewards. Check our interview with GS to learn more about how they are solving the problem of impermanent loss.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/this-week-in-frax-february-13-17th
36,"With the launch of Ethereum’s proof of stake (PoS), liquid staking derivative (LSD) tokens have exploded in popularity for people who want to achieve high ETH staking yields without the complexity of personally operating a staking node. Another key benefit for users is that holding a tokenized representation of their stake is becoming an increasingly useful asset in DeFi. Until recently, various LSDs on the market have achieved similar beacon chain yields - differences are attributable to slight variances in validator performance. This has led the market to differentiate these tokens mostly upon other metrics like liquidity, market discounts, and perceived decentralization. The launch of frxETH marked the arrival of a new LSD which has been able to attract competitive liquidity, and much higher yield. Changing the competitive landscape. An innovative AMO design - a key component in understanding the system - allows it to achieve meaningful yield via a mechanism completely unrelated to beacon chain revenue. While this approach is great for optimizing yield, it is also important for users to note that it alters the makeup of the system from traditional LSDs which are purely staking services, sending 100% of backing ETH to the beacon chain. In this article we will get into exactly what those differences are, where the yield comes from, and any new risks that users should be aware of. The frxETH AMO’s purpose is to: - Generate overall ETH/frxETH liquidity - Grow protocol owned liquidity (PoL) + farming revenue - Capture arbitrage profits Liquidity for an LSD pair is important for allowing people to enter/exit via the market at low cost while bypassing validator queuing periods. This is why part of the frxETH design is to send 10% of all user deposited ETH to the AMO to be added to the ETH/frxETH curve pool. This amount of ETH is referred to as “Withheld ETH”. Next, because the AMO has unlimited minting power, it mints an additional frxETH 1:1 for each ETH that has been withheld and then provides both as liquidity into the Curve pool. If we work through this flow for an example user who deposits 10 ETH, we can now expect the following to be true: For ever 10 ETH deposited by a user, 11 frxETH are minted (10 to user, 1 to AMO) 9 ETH is sent to the beacon chain, with staking yield to be distributed to sfrxETH users The AMO provides 1 ETH + 1 frxETH in liquidity to the ETH/frxETH Curve pool You can imagine that as more users enter frxETH the AMO can grow a very sizeable LP position and therefore is capable of generating significant farming rewards. One of the AMO’s policies is to recycle all earned rewards back into gauge voting bribes, which in turn grows the CRV emissions of the pool. Increased emissions attracts more LPs, and here’s the amazing thing about it: When more people exit sfrxETH to provide frxETH liquidity, that means remaining sfrxETH users get higher yield When more people provide ETH as liquidity, that means the AMO can mint more frxETH to the LP to balance the pool and generate more farming income (in the image above you can see actual amount of mints has surpassed the amount of withheld ETH) It is important to note that there is a flip side to this activity, which is that as users eventually decide to exit their ETH from system for any reason, the AMO must respond by scaling down using the inverse approach. That is, an outsized amount of frxETH will need to be removed from the pool and burned for every 1 ETH that a user requests to unstake. In summary , this liquidity provision comes at the cost of reduced overall staked ETH and therefore staking yield for sfrxETH users. But soon we will see why this 10% reduction in yield earning power can be made up for. Technically, during the course of normal operations, the total supply of frxETH in the system will exceed the amount of ETH in the system (withheld ETH + beacon chain ETH). However, this does not mean that the system is insolvent, or has bad debt. Rather, because the surplus is owned by the AMO’s LP position, it can be removed from the pool at any time to burn the debt and recover the ETH required to match user’s redemption. In fact, if the pool becomes overweight with frxETH, this will allow the AMO to withdraw it and burn this debt at a discount. The image below shows the lifetime arbitrage profitability of frxETH AMO’s deposits into the Curve pool. Notice that it has realized zero losses and that it has only generated profits thus far. This means that it has acted in a way which always puts the pool into balance, never out of balance. To date, the AMO has been performing exceptionally well and the system remains fully solvent. At the end of the day, the AMO is a simple multisig. The system relies on the good faith of the multisig and its actions. There are currently no smart contracts in place to restrict the behavior of the multisig (e.g. unlimited mint prevention, transfer restrictions, or enforced LP ranges). While the multisig has a great track record thus far, it can do a lot to reduce the amount of trust that users must necessarily place in it. LPs in the system also bear some risk. If an LP intends to get ETH back out at a good price, it must, to some degree, rely on the AMO (multisig) to act against its own interest to withdraw some of its position from the pool and balance it. The AMO inherently wants to keep a strong position in the pool to maximize farming rewards. The more imbalanced it becomes, the more it stands to profit. So far, the Frax Core team has proven to be good-faith actors when managing the AMO. So how is frxETH doing in the market today? The yield-optimizing design has proven to be a resounding success, with frxETH growing faster than any other LSD. Today, frxETH market cap is over $150 million and validator count is nearing 2,500 which is significant for a token which was deployed only 4 months ago. With the Shanghai hardfork nearing, beacon chain withdrawals will be enabled and we may see a large reallocation of staked ETH across providers. It will be exciting to monitor how this affects frxETH’s position in the market.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/a-walkthrough-of-the-frxeth-amo-and
37,"Watch the full episode at the end of the article Bitcoin is just money, a shiny digital rock used solely to pass perceived value back and forth between two addresses. Bitcoiners maximize trust and transactional capability above all. Network functions are limited to ensure anyone can run a full node, transforming it into a hardened digital bunker designed to survive any attack. But at the same time, Bitcoin is not meant to be innovated upon. Changes to the protocol are slow, scarce, and methodical, as to not break the singular core function.  There is no real answer as to whether this is the right method to build a blockchain. Entire digital religions have sprung up denouncing heretical evolutionaries who might enact other networks in the face of Bitcoin. I always found these arguments to be lacking, as innovation typically precludes incumbents from lasting unless their model of existence is airtight in every regard. Sreeram Kannan, founder of Eigenlayer was our guest this week. We interviewed him for almost 2 hours and he opened up to us in detail about his larger thoughts on the value systems for distributed networks. During the interview Sreeram told us: Finding Ethereum for me was a watershed moment because of the ideas mentioned above. Ethereum was the first distributed network to separate trust and innovation. First miners, now validators secure trust in the network, allowing for the ""surface area of permissionless innovation” to expand. Any anon can build on top of Ethereum services that the entire world can use and no one can be discriminated against. L2s further reduced the costs needed to bootstrap and maintain security, allowing for even more innovation to take place. It’s a paradigm shift in how we build digital products.  Eigenlayer is transformative, potentially more than any other alt-L1 or middleware protocol as it stands to completely separate trust and innovation, thus opening the door to anyone to try and construct novel applications, protocols and networks. In a couple of years we could look back on this time and wonder how the alt-L1 explosion of the early 2020’s ever could have happened with the current technology infinitely expanding the “surface area of innovation” for Ethereum. Eigenlayer is not a threat to existing systems, rather it will create a new competitive trust environment that hopefully will transform distributed networks to be vastly more efficient and secure.  Eigenlayer was founded by Sreeram Kannan, a faculty member at the University of Seattle, where he previously researched computational biology. Sreeram was always interested in distributed systems. He wrote his PhD thesis on P2P wireless systems in 2006, but the idea never really took off. Wireless infrastructure won out for its reliability and data speed. So after his PhD, he switched to computational genomics, completing his postdoc studies at Berkeley and Stanford, and then moving to Washington where he eventually became a faculty member. It wasn’t until 2018 that he started to really dive into crypto, when one of his previous advisors called him and asked him if he had heard of Bitcoin. The rest was just him falling down the crypto rabbit hole until he came up with the idea for Eigenlayer. Eigenlayer is a natural extension of Sreeram’s mental model of the world. These model define how he sees humanity, existence, and what it means to be human. One of his core mental models is based on Yuval Noah Harari’s book Sapiens, which argues that humanity’s  defining evolutionary advantage that allowed them to take over this planet is our ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers. For any other species, there is an element of wide societal trust missing, and this creates friction to cooperation. If these blockages can be reduced, groups can grow massively by means of cooperation.  Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are a new form of internet native innovations changing the world. Instead of information, they are a cooperation superhighway. Any person connected to the internet can now access these distributed value systems in a permissionless manner. Sreeram’s big application of his mental model was using the idea of the internet to make the jump to blockchain and crypto. He decided to upgrade the velocity of cooperation and hopefully accelerate the rate of innovation globally. So he dropped everything and moved over to crypto. The paradigm of innovation is that a “genius” comes up with a new idea and revolutionizes the field. But in reality, innovation is much more like evolution than intelligent design. People do science around different ideas, giving it a fitness, and then those ideas compete. The best ideas win and the process repeated. So once you have that mental model (Sreeram is all about mental models), the way you let innovation flourish is by letting many people compose pieces of innovation on top of each other. As I mentioned above, the most amazing thing about Ethereum is how it separated trust and innovation. Before blockchains, innovators faced uphill battles to build networks of trust. Attracting attention and getting funding is incredibly hard. You have to sell your vision to a select group of kingmakers (VCs) who take a cut of your business permanently in return for capital. The very nature of this process creates a required highly centralized and regulated financial system to remove trust issues. With distributed systems, however, users only have to trust the underlying network security if they believe the code is good. This is what Sreeram calls a “mind-bending” concept. Only with Ethereum-like networks is this possible. Sreeram noted this innovation was on the the same level of venture capital, which separates innovation and capital. People with ideas get together with people with capital. They both work together and create something new. This has led to huge growth over the last 70 years. Crypto radically changes the entry points into the system, rather than having to attend an Ivy League, work at a top firm, or know the right investors, any random anon can publish code that anyone in the world can consume. Sreeram said that unlike Google’s motto of “Don’t be evil,” for crypto the motto is “can’t discriminate,” as you don’t need to know who the end user is. The trust comes from the network, not the user, intermediary or government. In the first few years of Ethereum, the idea was to use sharding to expand network capabilities. But market forces eventually shuttered this idea, and the core dev team listened, giving into demands for L2 rollups. This paradigm shift was natural and market driven. It was the right choice and now L2s are the bedrock for Ethereum’s future. Eigenlayer in the next evolution of this scaling idea, moving beyond rollups to a full open trust layer that anyone can innovate on.  Everything that Eigenlayer is planning to rollout is fully dependent on the recent Proof of Stake transition, as now trust is programmable. Proof of Work is great for hardening network security, but its impossible to build in negative incentives to miners other than incorrect mining. You can’t slash in PoW, you can only fight to get block rewards. With PoS though, there is both a carrot and a stick; validators earn staking rewards, but they also can be slashed if they execute blocks incorrectly.  Functioning civilizations, in this case digital ones, need both positive and negative incentives to keep their populations in line. In the real world, we have monetary rewards for working, and also jail time and fines for perpetrating criminal acts. Before the switch the PoS, there was no way to punish someone for incorrectly publishing oracle feeds or data storage information. PoS now allows for programatic trust to be added to any validator who accepts.  Now, when you want to join Eigenlayer, you must choose which services to run. If you choose a compliance chain and you hate any and all censorship and refuse to validate certain blocks, your stake will be slashed. Same goes for any other network that is apart of Eigenlayer, they create rules on how the system should operate, and if the stakers refuse or incorrectly produce blocks, a penalty is assessed.  In our interview with ChainLinkGod, he said that Eigenlayer wasn’t a threat to existing networks with communities at large. He’s right, Eigenlayer isn’t a panacea. New ideas still have to be competent to execute on their idea and also to build communities. What it enables though is greater competition, as no incumbent protocol will have an advantage anymore solely due to its validator set and stake.  So how do you bootstrap a new protocol on Day 1 with Eigenlayer? Well the Ethereum restakers are already earning 5-6% native ETH yield. They then will be able to opt in to whichever services they want on Eigenlayer. Just like during DeFi summer, a new protocol can launch and offer a token in return for security. The token might be worthless at first, but some restakers might take the chance that it could be worth something someday.  Unlike in DeFi, the risks to the restakers are smaller, as they are committed to their ETH stake and don’t mind price fluctuations. They just want to be sure they are earning more ETH or yield. It’s a different risk category, so there should be an easier uptake to Eigenlayer than with DeFi.  Eigenlayer can support new L1s, middleware, and even smaller projects which never would have made sense to build before. There’s a weird paradox for Eigenlayer, that as more apps and protocols are secured by Ethereum restakers, the network grows more resilient. Sreeram noted that blockchains are like nation-states, and dapps are like cities. Dapps get their security from the nation-state, they don’t protect themselves. It would be strange if each city or department of the government had its own independent police force and military. You can’t run a country this way, you need an integrated security force. Once you secure your own nation, you can export your security to other nations in partnerships like NATO or the UN.  What this means for Eigenlayer is that once an oracle is launched, its data is secured by all of the Ethereum restakers supporting it. It can now provide its price feed services to any blockchain or any network. Ethereum stakers are planning to run expensive validator nodes for other networks like Solana or Aptos, but they can provide middleware services backed by the highest network security in existence. So a new L1 can bootstrap immediately all these cool services without having to build it themselves. Ethereum becomes, as Sreeram calls it, “a net exporter of security. Eventually, all of the technical arbitrage between L1s is removed and what’s left are the strongest communities and most innovative teams.  Sreeram wants to use Eigenlayer to create a new commons, where anyone can build on top of other creators in a non-permissioned way. He thinks the ideal system would basically have a “permissionless innovation license.” This would allow creators and builders to innovate on top of previous works, creating new derivatives, all while paying fees back to the original creator as attribution. In this sense, we can move past existing copyright models that inhibit growth and creativity, instead working towards a more transparent and open society where the pace of innovation is constantly accelerated.  It’s the same model as we described earlier with the cranes and skyhook. Sreeram wants more cranes, and also more incentives to build more cranes. It’s all about mental models and Eigenlayer is truly poised to drive the next wave of innovation in crypto.  Not financial or tax advice.

38,"Welcome to Frax Check. Your weekly frax vibe check. I am your host Kapital_K and I’m joined by my cohost DeFi Dave and our producer extraordinaire Sam. We will be going straight to the source of truth via checking the chain. Before we jump in, please subscribe to the flywheel, it really does help! Please also follow us @flywheeldefi on Twitter and tg. This week... I call this week the “Speechless” week. As the name suggests, this week things were quite surreal. Let’s start with the flagship product: $FRAX stablecoin. We see the Supply has been holding steady at $1B-ish, unchanged from last week – even after the whole market turmoil. Next, we must check the peg, which got as low as $0.898 with a high of $1.001 for the week. The peg unfortunately was pegged to 1 USDC rather than 1 USD as we saw USDC got to the same low range. We then looked at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We received a 0.9992 exchange rate. This is frankly the best exchange rate we’ve seen for the FraxBP – if you’re wanting to trade from FRAX to USDC now is the time. Moving on, we have our Collateralization %. This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. We’re unchanged at 92%. Following we have the Decentralize %, which saw a decrease of 1.7% and are now sitting at 23.5%.  For this week we saw the FraxBP TVL dropped to $465.5M, which is -10.8% decrease from last week – tvl has declined three weeks in a row now. On the right side we have a new metric I wanted to start looking at which is the volume traded. For context, in February we hit 49.3M, and in first two weeks of March we hit 165M. This represents a 35.5% utilization rate. The Stablecoin trading volume has been ridiculously profitable for Curve this past week. Following this slide, we have a yield and bribes section, where I look at the current yield being offered to LP into this pool and the bribes Frax Finance had to pay for the yield. You see here that there’s an APR of 1.7% so the estimated $378k of yield for the 14-day epoch because Votium epochs are 14 days, then we compare that to the bribes paid. This epoch so far, we paid $241k so rough back of the envelope math says we’re doing pretty good so far this month. However it’s important to note that Frax Finance’s POL isn’t the only liquidity in the pool so its reward shares are definitely diluted but that’s part of the plan as Frax wants to attract liquidity into the FraxBP. To that end, $733 of liquidity were incentivized by $1 of bribes paid. Now, we march forward to my favorite section of the Frax Check. We are 117% of 3pool. Glad there are some good news in this week’s Frax Check. The FraxBasedPool is $465M versus 3pool's $396M. Now, it wasn’t easy to get to the top but now we must stay at the top. If we’re able to maintain this ratio, then I believe the FraxBP will continue to remain at the top as liquidity begets more liquidity.  The 3POOL is still highly imbalanced so I think it’s going to take some quite some time for it to find its footing again, while the FraxBP is near its best pool composition of 40/60.   Next, we have our FrxETH segment. We start by checking the frxETH supply. As always, it’s up only! The count is at 114,961. And look at that chart, I know you can’t read it but just appreciate the verticalness off that graph. +2.5% -- not too shabby. I do think we may slow down in percentage growth terms as we’re getting to size, but I hope we don’t! Let’s look at where the frxETHs are hanging out! As a reminder, You can stake your frxETH into the sfrxETH vault to earn the native ETH staking yield. And in that vault we see that 55% of the frxETH is chilling and stacking ETH earning a nice native staking yield. The other place you can take your frxETH is to the curve pool of frxETH/ETH, where you can join 37% of the frxETH supply. The remainder 8% is floating in the ether somewhere. I think the yield parity between the sfrxETH and Curve pool is reflected in the current split. Unless Frax cranks up the bribes a bit more, I think we’ll see this heavier flow into sfrxETH. And also lets note that there’s 9% of frxETH just chilling, this number is increasing more and more these last few weeks. But enough talk of the supply and the yield, let’s get down to the peg. Peg check is as lowest as it’s ever been at 0.9968. But it’s actually worst when we go into the market. I tried to swap a 3500 frxETH which is roughly the amount of the largest frxETH holder and I get an exchange rate of 0.9956. This is also a historic low. Fortunately, the TVL is quite sticky at $115M, still 9 SOLID FIGURES. So far so good, let’s see how we stack up with the other competitors. Here we layout the LSD market landscape. We have Lido in the lead with 74.8% of the market. Though, Frax REMAINED the highest 30-day delta in the group, at +22.8% so far. FrxETH’s market share is at 1.49%. Let’s keep fighting the good fight! On the yield landscape, frxETH pretty much dominates with a 6.5% and the closest competitor is surprisingly this week was Lido at 6.2%. But these figures on DeFi Llama doesn’t tell the full story as sfrxETH stakers earned 16%+ APR this week due to the massive MEV that it captured during the crazy market situation. Peg check could be better. Curve swap could be better. Count up-only. Staked % healthy. Next we have a new section I added. Another one of Frax’s product that might not get as much as love as the other products is FPI. Quick refresher, FPI is a Frax Price Index, which is a stablecoin that tracks inflation. This is the first product of its kind on chain. Let’s run through the numbers! So far, we have 82.3M supply of FPI, current inflation reading is 6.3% and the FPI peg is ABOVE by 0.81% of its peg. And you’re wondering how it maintains its peg to inflation, well that’s what the treasury is for. For the record, FPI’s treasury is at $88.2M. Similar to how the AMOs work for Frax stablecoin’s treasury, the FPI’s treasury is made up of FPI, FRAX, and a small percentage holding of FXS. As you can see 95% of the treasury is in the FPI/FRAX conve. The team deployed the 10% of FPI and FRAX that were sitting in the comptroller contract to add more stability to FPI. All these assets are put to work just like in the AMO to earn that needed yield to keep FPI at the inflation peg. Next we have our FraxLend section. We saw a massive drop in TVL of nearly $100M. We currently at 107M in TVL with $27M in borrowed FRAX. The Utilization rate dropped by 17% down to 66% from just a week ago. From the two charts, we see that the Supply Value of FRAX just took a nose dive alongside with the Collateral Value. We pretty much hit reset on both of these values and started near the beginning of FraxLend again. Currently, there are many pairs being offered on FraxLend but more and more are being added. Also look at the current Supply APY for gOHM/FRAX pair. A whopping 10.8%. then right behind it is the CRV/FRAX pair at 9.5%. A little further down the list you see there’s the sfrxETH/FRAX pool with a juicy 6.7% APY. Be sure to listen to our Governance Roundup to get any alpha on any future pairs. The last leg of the Stablecoin Maximalism: the DEX aka FraxSwap. Per DeFi Llama, the TVL is $65.6M with 85M monthly volume for March so far. I just took the Monthly volume divided by the TVL to get a utilization rate of 121% -- surprisingly this isn’t as high as what I thought we would see given th volume Curve was putting up. Finally, let’s jump into our profitability section starting an overview of the AMO holdings. We are down quite badly. The grand total of all AMOs dropped by over $150M. The Curve AMO dropped by 100M down to $606M, Liquidity $75M, lost $5M, Lending $79.9M lost $15M, and Investor 179M, lost 45M. It’s going to take us quite some time to regain all of these assets into the treasury. But Flywheel DeFi will be here every week reporting in on every step of the journey. Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. For the month of March, we have $670k in revenue and $890k in bribe expense, which means we are at a loss of $220k for March. We have a bribe payment coming up shortly so we will see higher losses for the month – with the market no longer in the echo bubble mode, I feel this is going to be a red month for us.

39,"Last week, Coinbase CEO Brian Armstrong dropped an ominous tweet that he had heard “the SEC would like to get rid of crypto staking in the U.S. for retail customers.” Less than a day later, news broke that Kraken had agreed to settle with the SEC for not registering the offering and sale of its crypto staking program. Kraken agreed to cease offering of the service and also to pay a $30m fine Here are the the key argument of the SEC’s opinion: • Staking-as-a-service and pooling of staked assets provides and advantage over self staking. • Kraken’s customers were “passive” participants, providing their assets to Kraken to actively manage. • While on-chain staking yields are determined by code, Kraken’s yields were internally and opaquely determined. • Kraken kept returns which exceeded the marketed range of yield and did not disclose this to customers. Nor did Kraken properly disclose their fees or operating costs for the staking program. • Not all tokens were staked. Kraken held back some liquid tokens for itself to use at their discretion. • Staking rewards were also payed out weekly, whereas self-staking follows no schedule. • Some staking protocols require minimums, however Kraken did not. Also, depositing the token to Kraken’s staking program did not require paying fees, which are required to stake on chain. Staking on Kraken, the SEC argues, was fundamentally different than self-staking. This made the service and product offering fall under the purview of the SEC and they argue Kraken should have registered the offering with the SEC. “Whether it’s through staking-as-a-service, lending, or other means, crypto intermediaries, when offering investment contracts in exchange for investors’ tokens, need to provide the proper disclosures and safeguards required by our securities laws,” said SEC Chair Gary Gensler. “Today’s action should make clear to the marketplace that staking-as-a-service providers must register and provide full, fair, and truthful disclosure and investor protection.” The SEC further said that Kraken “offered investors outsized returns untethered to any economic realities, but also retained the right to pay them no returns at all. All the while, it provided them zero insight into, among other things, its financial condition and whether it even had the means of paying the marketed returns in the first place.” Crypto is stuck in purgatory right now. Without new laws to govern explicitly how certain assets, products and services can be sold, regulatory agencies will continue to use their enforcement powers to penalize companies after the fact. I doubt Kraken intended to violate securities laws, it’s just impossible for them to receive valid legal advicewith how opaquely the regulators determine what’s acceptable. Two consequences arise from the settlement. First, all other centralized staking services are questionable if their terms of service match in anyway what Kraken had provided.  Coinbase quickly issued a statement on how their cbETH staking derivative was markedly different from Kraken’s program. Unlike Kraken, which just laid off 30% of its workforce and is facing revenue reductions in the bear market, Coinbase has vowed to fight the SEC over its staking program. The settlement is in now way a final judgement, Kraken admits no guilt. Congress or the courts are going to have to decide this question eventually. Second, all of the staked ETH that Kraken was managing must be unstaked and returned to its customers when Shanghai is deployed. At the time of the settlement, Kraken is managing 1,233,728 ETH or 8% of the total market share for staked ETH. Full withdrawals, which Kraken will need to execute, have a churn limit function that controls the amount of nodes that can exit each epoch. Currently there are 514,790 active ETH PoS validators, leaving the churn limit at 7. What this means that is only 7 full withdrawals can be processed each epoch (6.4 minutes). Assuming Kraken needs to unstake approximately 30% of their ETH for their US based customer, it will take 98 days at a minimum if Kraken is the only entity unstaking. Pair this with every other LSD/staking service providing full withdrawals at the same time, and it could mean the initial exit queue for ETH validators could extend well past 1 year initially. Its almost as if Kraken needs a better way to allow investors to exit through a DEX??? Hmm, once again, all road lead to Frax. In the wake of the Kraken enforcement action, investors piled into LSD tokens, as the move is thought to be a further argument for decentralized asset products. FXS was up initially, but declined over the weekend. It’s too early to tell the knock on effects for all staking services and LSD’s, but this is a wakeup call to the industry that fully decentralized on-chain solutions are needed to escape any classification as a security. ""Paxos has informed us that they have been directed to cease minting new BUSD by the New York Department of Financial Services (NYDFS),"" the NYDFS said. ""BUSD is a stablecoin wholly owned and managed by Paxos. As a result, BUSD market cap will only decrease over time. Paxos will continue to service the product, manage redemptions, and will follow-up with additional information as required."" As of writing, Binance Peg BUSD is fully backed. But based on the data, Binance manipulated the BUSD mint process in the past to issue unbacked BUSD. Binance had full control over the BUSD on BSC and did not disclose these risks to buyers. If Binance was issuing an unbacked money like instrument, this would raise cause for labelling it an unregistered security by the SEC. If this is the reason, the scope of the SEC’s case would not be cause for concern for other stablecoin issuers. The SEC learned a lot in the wake of the [Tether debacle](https://21shares.com/research/the-tether-bitfinex-investigation), when the company failed to disclose collateral loses of 80% incurred by Crypto Capital. Tether later settled with the NYDFS and paid a fine of $18.5mln. What does this mean for Frax? Well nothing at the current moment. Until the SEC publishes their complaint, it will be unclear the scope of their enforcement. For what it’s worth, the SEC is loathe to enter into drag out cases that can go on for years, like the XRP case. They have a history of going for settlement against actors who would rather not fight for years in court. For now the stablecoin business model is safe, but the recent actions by the Biden administration are worrying.

For those unfamiliar with the situation, Wavey0x took a meander into the FrxETH AMO and tweeted some conclusions, some of which that were less than accurate.

41,"Core team member Clonescody also published part of Umami Labs LLC’s insider trading policy that defined the penalties for selling tokens using non-public information. According to the policy, O’Donnell could have been terminated as CEO for violating the policy.  Hire the former Umami Labs LLC team as Umami DAO contractors. Alex Golubitsky will also be retained as CLO.  Rights to the code stay with the DAO and revenues will be shared between marinators as staking revenue and the DAO owned treasury at the previously agreed upon rates (50/50 split) Treasury revenue distribution will be reinstated to stakers at the previous rate of 50% revenue The Umami Labs agreement with the Umami DAO will be dissolved in full. This vote will be renewed in 6 months. If the repetitional damage is beyond repair, Afirebrand recommends a vote be put up to dissolve the DAO and distribute treasury assets to token holders. In addition to the infighting over legal counsel, O’Donnell was justifying the transition as a reason to transfer treasury assets from the DAO into Umami Labs LLC, where he was CEO and a shareholder. Labs is a wholly owned subsidiary of Umami Holdings LLC, and Labs was the operational entity, servicing the DAO. Labs’ governance was structured so that O’Donnell would have final decision making authority and he had been lobbying privately for multi-sig members to transfer the treasury to Umami Labs LLC. This would have effectively neutered the DAO and its voting power, and given O’Donnell full control over access and strategy over the asset war-chest. The situation came to a head on the night of Tuesday, February 7, when the Core team made a unified request of O’Donnell to change course. At first he tentatively agreed, then reneged on his decision the following morning. In response, the entire team fully resigned from Umami Labs LLC and took to Twitter to make their case public. Late Wednesday, Clonescody, another Core team member, led a three hour voice discussion in Discord rallying the community around the original mission of the Umami DAO. He assured the DAO that funds were safe, the project would continue, and the damage O’Donnell had inflicted would be undone. Afterwards, he posted an update to his personal Twitter account stating Umami would be transitioned back to a DAO, O’Donnell had been fully removed, his vesting contract shut off, and, most importantly, that Umami DAO retained control of the code base, vault products, and front end. Former CLO Alex Golubitsky told Flywheel: Carl Alexander O'Donnell, the former CEO of Umami Labs, abused his position within Umami Labs, a services company for the Umami DAO, to attempt to transfer the Umami treasury to Umami Labs in contravention of both the agreement between Umami Labs and the DAO, and the publicly stated policy of Labs. He was stymied in this effort by Umami's controls on treasury assets. Once he realized that he could not abuse his position of trust in Umami Labs, he opted to dump his accrued tokens on the market, in contravention of his fiduciary duties and Umami Labs policy. What transpired at Umami in the recent weeks represents a failure of centralization, and underscores the importance of decentralized governance for community accountability. The damage that Mr. O'Donnell caused, which was minimized greatly by the quick actions and diligence of Umami team members, was allowed by the centralization of control in Umami Labs. In fact, Mr. O'Donnell's actions demonstrate how 'compliance' can be a trojan horse, allowing bad actors to centralize control under the guise of government regulation. Umami Labs is tarnished as a brand, and will be terminated as quickly as possible. It is my sincere hope that people are able to distinguish the incredible team and community at Umami DAO from the failed experiment of Umami Labs. I am very optimistic for the launch of the Umami's vaults, by the DAO, and I look forward to this chapter of Umami's history being closed in favor of a bright future ahead. Now that O’Donnell has exited his position, the Umami team will continue with the launch of their planned vaults for GLP next month. The team said in Discord that the shakeup will only setback the launch of the vaults by a week or two. Authors note: We reached out to O’Donnell at 10am EST while writing the publication and shared a draft. He said that he would be making a statement later in the day. At 3pm we decided to publish without his comment. He later wrote to us that the article is “filled with inaccuracies” and that it wasn’t reasonable to give less than 24 hours for comment. O’Donnell did not provide any further information as to what was false or untrue. you need to catch up on updates.. Umami labs is suing its former employees for violating their agreements. employees are now trying arbitration as per twitter - clearly they did not think far enough.

43,"Welcome to Frax Check. Your weekly frax vibe check. I am your host Kapital_K and I’m joined our producer extraordinaire Sam. We will be going straight to the source of truth via checking the chain. Before we jump in, please subscribe to the flywheel, it really does help! Please also follow us @flywheelfi on Twitter and tg. This week.. I call this week the “As Good As Planned” week. As the name suggests, this week things are good. It feels eerily good. You’ll see what I mean as we dive in! Frax Check will now break up into two main sections: Product Lines and Profitability. As the name suggests, for the first section, we’re going to go through some of Frax’s products such as FRAX (the stablecoin), frxETH (the stablecoin), FraxBP, FraxLend, FraxSwap, you get the idea. Then we’ll investigate the Profitability across these products. Thanks for reading Flywheel DeFi! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. We start with the flagship product: $FRAX stablecoin. We see the Supply has been holding steady at $1B-ish for the past month or so. Not much to update here. Then obvs, we must check the peg, which got as low as $0.999 with a high of $1.003 for the week. Peg Check = Strong. We then looked at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We received a 0.9986 exchange rate. This is 2 bps better than last week. Nothing newsworthy this week so moving on we have our Collateralization %. This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. We remained unchanged for the week still at 92%, it’s been this way for 6 Frax Checks now. Following we have the Decentralize %. A while ago, we saw a big reversal jumping but this week, we’re up a good amount with 6% over last week – quite possibly from FXS pahmping. Still V v v v much bear market vibes across the board when it comes to these two metrics. The Frax team has a goal to get it to one hunnid! But some members of the community wants to see the Collat % going back to the low 80s and the Decent % going back to 30s. But I’m hopeful. Okay. Quick summary Health Check. Peg Good. Curve Swap unchanged Collat % could be better been stagnant. Decent % may be in a reversal to the upside. Next, we have the FraxBP product, which imo is sort of like liquidity as a service. The FraxBP has been holding steady at just about $500M for the past few months. For this week we saw the TVL got to $493.6M, which is 30bps decrease from last week so pretty much unchanged. On the right side we have a new metric I wanted to start looking at which is the volume traded. For context, in January we had 12.1M, and in the first week of February we hit 13.1M already. Though, this is still only 2.7% of the $500M TVL. Not great tbh but we have the rest of the month ahead. But also said differently, there’s more than sufficient liquidity to facilitate magnitudes more volume than where we are at now. Following this slide, we have a yield and bribes section, where I look at the current yield being offered to LP into this pool and the bribes Frax Finance had to pay for the yield. You see here that there’s an APR of 2.62% for a $500M pool so the estimated $502k of yield. The quick math is take TVL of $500M, multiply by 2.62%, divide by 365, multiply by 14 days (because Votium epochs are 14 days). Then we compare that to the bribes paid we see if there was any net gain on the bribes. This epoch so far, we paid $291k so rough back of the envelope math says we’re doing pretty good so far this month. However it’s important to note that Frax Finance’s POL isn’t the only liquidity in the pool so its reward shares are definitely diluted but that’s part of the plan as Frax wants to attract liquidity into the FraxBP. To that end, $606 of liquidity were incentivized by $1 of bribes paid. Now, we march forward to my favorite section of the Frax Check. Ladies and gents, we are… drumroll…. at 89% of the 3pool, yet again for 3 weeks in a row. The FraxBasedPool is $493.6M versus 3pool's $551.9M. What’s noteworthy is that the FraxBP didn’t gain the TVL but rather 3pool losing its TVL (more than $9M versus $2M for FraxBP). Note that we are STILL above the Frax3CRV pool!!! Let’s keep the momentum going. Steppingstones, 3Pool next. Moving on, let’s chat about our metapools. Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP. We’re at $75.8M, an increase of 14.7% from last week. We finally broke above the $50M level after 9 Frax Checks. On the following slide, we’ll quickly cover some yields on these metapools as well as the bribes paid. Because there are quite a few stablepair metapools, I’m only looking at the top ones by TVL. We see that BUSD and GUSD are both at 1.9% – interesting that these CEX stablecoins aren’t requiring a higher premium. This is below the FraxBP APR, who is LPing in these pools. This could be an interesting on-chain analysis. The alUSD and FRAXBP pair is paying out 8% APR at nearly $11M in TVL. Honestly, still not too shabby if you believe/trust in alchemix’s mechanism and collateral set. On the bribes front, Frax paid $49k for the month of January so far. And if we look at Liquidity per Bribe Dollar, Frax was able to pull in $1,537 per $1 of bribes spent. So, c’mon people, we got some yield and liquidity for your community, so come and get some! Any projects out there looking to work with the Metapool, please join the Flywheel TG chat and DM any of the hosts for assistance. Also one quick note, we also have an additional $17.5M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. That is a nice jump of 4.2% over last week. Similarly, I wanted to look at some of the yield and the bribes for these non-stable metapool pairs. For this category, I went the other route and sorted by APR. We see here that OHM-FRAXBP is offering a whopping 44% APR! Wooh! Then we have the usual flywheel suspects of CVX, cvxCRV, and cvxFXS at a range between 21 - 35%. Alcx/FraxBP is also paying a nice 41%. On the bribes side, Frax paid $12.7k so far in January and the liquidity incented is $1,400 of liquidity per $1 of bribe spent. So, adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $93.3M of liquidity paired against FraxBP – up 12.7% this week. Summary time. Liquidity Check. FraxBP is 495.2M which is 89% of 3Pool. The MetaPool is at $75.8M for stable pairs and $17.5M for non-stable pairs. And TVL of All pairs (stables + non-stables) are at $93.3M. Next, we have our FrxETH segment. We start by checking the frxETH supply. As always, it’s up only! The count is at 87,308. And look at that chart, I know you can’t read it but just appreciate the verticalness off that graph. +7.4%. Hot. Let’s look at where the frxETHs are hanging out! As a reminder, You can stake your frxETH into the sfrxETH vault to earn the native ETH staking yield. And in that vault we see that 50.5%, (1.8% increase over last week) of the frxETH is chilling and stacking ETH earning a nice 7% APR. The other place you can take your frxETH is to the curve pool of frxETH/ETH, where you can join 46% (down 5% from last week) of the frxETH supply earning 8% APR in CVX, CRV, FXS. The remainder 1.7% is floating in the ether somewhere. But enough talk of the supply and the yield, let’s get down to the peg. Peg check here is literally AS strong AS it ever could be, you see the price delta at 0.0000 between frxETH and ETH. But, we obvs have to go into the market and check this ourselves and you see here that I tried to swap a 3500 frxETH which is roughly the amount of the largest frxETH holder and I get an exchange rate of 0.9985. That’s not too shabby, unchanged from last week. And also let’s just note the TVL here, we’re at $128M. 9 SOLID FIGURES baby. So far so good, let’s see how we stack up with the others. Here we layout the LSD market landscape. Obvs, we have Lido in the lead with 29% of the market but you can see here that Frax REMAINED the highest 30-day delta in the group, at +74% so far. FrxETH’s market share is at 0.43%. It’s not official-official yet since there’s a 1 week or so delay of validator set up, but next week I’m sure we’ll overtake Stakewise and be in the top 3 officially! Let’s keep fighting the good fight! On the yield landscape, frxETH pretty much dominates with a 7.28% and the closest competitor is Stakewise at 5.63 %. We are the best game in town so come get some of this gud gud! Peg check strong. Curve swap strong. Count up-only. Staked % healthy. Next we have a new section I added. Another one of Frax’s product that might not get as much as love as the other products is FPI. Quick refresher, FPI is a Frax Price Index, which is a stablecoin that tracks inflation. This is the first product of its kind on chain. So lets run through the numbahs! So far, we have 82M supply of FPI, current inflation reading (since Dec 2022) is 6.4% and the FPI peg is only short 0.08% of its peg. And you’re wondering how does it maintain its peg to inflation, well that’s what the treasury is for. Like how the AMOs work for Frax stablecoin’s treasury, the FPI’s treasury is made up of FPI, FRAX, and a small percentage holding of FXS. As you can see 85% of the treasury is in the FPI/FRAX convex, with another 10% just consisting of FPI & FRAX chilling in the Controller/Comptroller smart contracts. All these assets are put to work just like in the AMO to earn that needed yield to keep FPI at the inflation peg. Next we have our FraxLend section. We’ve snatched a TVL of $235M with $49.9M in borrowed FRAX. The charts I like to look at are the Collateral Value and the Supply Value. These are great proxies for trust in the product. A good confidence check and you see the graphs are trending up and to the right. Following that I like to check the utilization %, which for me is how much of the total supply has been borrowed, and we’re at 77.5% utilization rate across all the lending pairs. This is a slightly different way of looking at utilization rates, but I prefer it. Currently, there are many pairs being offered on FraxLend but more and more are being added. Also take a look at the current Supply APY for crv/FRAX pair. A whopping 7.5%, but caveat here with what happened with Aave not too long ago with CRV and lending markets. Be sure to listen to our Governance Roundup to get any alpha on any future pairs. There’s another cool visualization of the loan health that I want to highlight. The largest position on FraxLend is nearly 21M FRAX being borrowed against 104M of CRV, as you can see the position is quite healthy, and from a quick glance, most positions on fraxlend are quite healthy. The last leg of the DeFi Trinity: the DEX aka FraxSwap. Per DeFi Llama, the TVL is $73.5M with a 53.9M monthly volume so far for February. I just took the Monthly volume divided by the TVL to get a utilization rate of 73%. Granted the volume this past month has been picking up so if you look at December, which looks to be about a third so utilization rate could be in the 70%s, but that’s still pretty good. In February so far, we’re already at 1/3 of January’s volume and its only the first week. Now there is a slight discrepancy between DeFi Llama’s reported TVL and the one on Frax Facts but that’s because of the massive $85M FraxFPI pool that DeFi Llama isn’t including in the TVL. Finally, let’s jump into our profitability section starting an overview of the AMO holdings. We have a grand total of $1050.0M across all the AMOs. This was a $10M change over last week with $4M going into the Investor AMO and $6M into the Liquidity AMO. The Curve AMO is at 712M, Liquidity $87M, Lending $71M, and Investor 180M. Things are quite okay on the AMO front.  Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. For the month of February so far, we have $470k in revenue and $1M in bribe expense. As you can see, most of our revenue comes from CRV rewards, magnitudes larger than the CVX and FXS rewards. With a net loss of $540k to start our month. We have a long way to climb to get over this profitability hurdle but it’s growth time so we gotta pay to play. Another thing to note here is that with FXS price bumping the past 2 weeks, bribes are getting expensive since they’re paid in FXS. Quick summary money check. AMO holdings was $1050.0M, +1.0% WoW.

44,"We see you Frax Bull For another week we’re leading the FiR with another BIG interview with Sam K. The Empire dropped the episode this morning right as we were writing. This is an interview you should share around, Sam K lays out the mission and goals for Frax very clearly. For anyone not into Frax, or is trying to learn about Frax, this should be one of the first places they start. Lets go over some of the big highlights: • Stablecoin Maxis -The reason Frax is a stablecoin maxi, is that at end of the day, the most useful and profitable part is the ability to generate a liability that people can use as a currency. This is all just modern day banking activity for the crypto generation. The goal for Frax is to build all of the risk free assets in crypto, so that regular investors will want to hold spot. • Borrow AMM (BAMM) - A brand new product that will be released sometime in 2023 :0 Sam K announced BAMM where “you can borrow “stuff ‘ and have spot liquidity without external oracles. The idea is to capture the long tail of the market. Sam K said that the goal should be that BAMM should not be risky for the protocol. • The multi-sig is getting fully decentralized in q2. It will be governed by veFXS holders. “While we suggest the community to wait for the feedback from risks teams Gauntlet (@Pauljlei) & @ChaosLabs, the ACI suggests the following risk parameters to start the conversation. These parameters define a non-borrowable asset with a 60% LTV.” • Move the 10% Convex Frax protocol fee from the cvxFXS-FXS curve liquidity pool to a single sided staking cvxFXS contract. • Move the veFXS fees from the cvxFXS-FXS curve liquidity pool to single sided cvxFXS staking contract. Up until now, all rewards have been sold back into the LP pool. This, along with additional sell pressures, have driven the spread wide. Creation of a single staking option for cvxFXS will lessen sell pressure and allow for more interesting positions to be created. Flywheel grant passed!

45,"Well $1 equals $1 A pound equals a pound A euro is a euro. Ok, so what about dollars in pounds? Or Euros in dollars? What about dollars in oil or gold? What about a dollar in 1 year, or 30? Different monies can have different prices. These four prices are crucial to understanding the financial markets and how money works in modern finance. The four prices of money are: Par Interest Foreign Exchange Price Level But a few hundred years ago, when there were multiple state and private monies issued, questions around par were very present. If you brought money from another state or bank that was far away, it might not have been accepted at face value. You might have been charged a few percent discount on your money to transact with it. The money’s value could only be redeemed by returning to the state or bank operating area, thus the extra premium. In 2023, everything is digital and the United States has gone through a long process of fortifying, centralizing, and homogenizing the dollar so that it’s accepted everywhere at face value. For example, bank deposits are convertible into physical cash, and you would expect to get one dollar of cash for every dollar of deposits. This is what is known as par. Now, when you swap money between your bank, Cashapp, Coinbase, or any other third party application, you rarely have to pay fees to do so. Same dollar amounts magically appear in different accounts… its the wonder of technology and strong consumer protections enacted at the federal and state levels. Anywhere there is debt, questions of par arise, as most all modern money is debt issued. In cases where repayment of debt is questionable, say when your multi-billion dollar exchange is burning to the ground. Lets review the 4 price of money again Par (Today’s value) Interest (Future value) Foreign Exchange (Relative value) Price Level (Absolute value, value in commodities and goods) Ok so where do stablecoins fit in all of this? The last two points on the price of money we can leave aside for this discussion. 90+% of all stables are dollars. Crypto traders don’t think of Bitcoin or ETH in domestic currency terms. Additionally, the stablecoin market is less than $100bn and the quantity of stables only affects crypto prices.  Commercial paper is short term unsecured debt issued by corporations. It’s not government issued, which means the default risk can be much, much higher. Tether further stated that its commercial paper had a variety of A ratings, with no further detail. Much fanfare was given to Tether’s announcement at the time, every big new agency picked up the story and a lot of handwringing was made on CT about the solvency of Tether. Just a year later similar questions about FTX’s solvency led to its collapse within 2 weeks. But here we are nearly 2 years after the report came out and Tether is chugging along better than a cockroach in the nuclear apocalypse. The only times Tether’s peg has deviated was when the entire markets were burning down and investors were running for the exit. Remember how all stablecoin issuers invest their cash into yield? Well it becomes locked in the notes and other debt securities they buy. When the shit hits the fan due to “effective altruism,” investors rush to redeem to move to cash. Fiat in the bank is far more safe than dollars on-chain. So the stable issuer has to pony up what can be an insane amount of cash in a short amount of time. Here’s the problem.. If Tether dishes out all of the 6bn they have in cash, they have to move onto more illiquid assets. Looking at their balance sheet, once the cash is gone Tether moves onto treasuries and then… the commercial paper. Its a chain of illiquidity. Treasuries are liquid, but commercial paper… hmm no. So when you go to sell your commercial paper, especially when the shit is hitting the fan, you might have to sell it for 95 cents on the dollar. Fine for a few million… but billions? Houston we got a problem. Interest rates are an interesting bit. Ask yourself a question. Why do stablecoin issuers pay no interest? The dollar is constantly being devalued and loses 2% to inflation on average every year. Furthermore, every stablecoin in existence has to be held by someone until it’s unminted or burned. So someone, somewhere has to be willing to hold stables with no possibility of receiving any of the profit Circle or Tether makes from its businesses. Circle is on track to make hundreds of millions of dollars this year and USDC holders will see none of it. It’s weird isn’t it? When you put money into a bank account, either checking or savings, you always get interest, even if it's like less than half of a percent a year. The bank compensates its depositors for letting them use their funds in loans and other profit making operations. Circle and Tether do the same thing with their collateral deposits. They invest a good portion into a variety of short term treasuries and other highly liquid assets to earn a yield. Right now short term treasuries are earning around 4% a year. After operating costs and fees, the actual yield is probably around 2%, which goes straight to Tether and Circle shareholders pockets. The problem (or lack thereof) is that crypto people don’t care enough to demand those profits. Since DeFi summer kicked off in 2020, the yields have been stupid, prices have pumped and the demand for leverage was insatiable. Even now in the depths of the bear market close to a billion dollars of USDC is in the lending market Aave earning just 1.49%. Purely rational investors should look at the yield and pull their liquidity to go invest into treasuries to earn the extra 2.5%. One option that could work given that crypto monies are “tokens” is by offering on-chain treasuries. Treasuries pay an interest rate, even with short term durations. We don’t use treasuries as cash in the wider market because securities in their current form are cumbersome, require intermediaries and fluctuate in price. But in token form treasuries get super powers, as they can be traded and used in AMMs like Uniswap and Curve. In everyday real life, we humans think about numbers and money in whole amounts. But with an AMM, you can have trillions of tokens of Shigecoin and swap them with one click to billions of Arrr-thereum (pirate themed memecoin). By hiding all the math, AMMs make transacting asset independent; it doesn’t matter if you are trading oil, crypto, gold, or any other asset so long as it's tokenized. Ondo funds exist not to be money, but to serve as collateral and access crypto credit markets. Ondo DAO also governs Flux Finance, a decentralized lending protocol with OUSG, DAI, and USDC markets. The fOUSG market will respect the KYC/AML restrictions of OUSG, while there are no such restrictions for fUSDC and fDAI. These onerous restrictions on treasuries make them poor substitutes for money. Another option that could work as money is y, a, or c-tokens from Yearn, Aave, or Compound respectively. These wrapped interest bearing tokens have no transfer restrictions and can be traded on AMMs without KYC. They also are instantly unwrappable into their underlying assets. However, each comes with additional protocol risk which the base collateral doesn’t have. So while there are money-like substitutes in crypto that pay an interest rate, their demand is fractured and weakened by protocol risk. Boring, run-of-the-mill stable dollars are preferred over other options even though their value is constantly declining. Is there a better option? Not at the moment. Until there are stronger regulations for banking on crypto networks, stablecoins will be lacking. This is the core reason why Frax needs a FMA account. The billions and soon to be trillions of dollars in collateral Frax controls must constantly be used to find yield in DeFi, while Circle keeps all the profits made from investing off-chain for themselves. With an FMA, Frax can issue its own stablecoin for on-chain collateral and swap all of the USDC into their own branded and controlled collateral asset. FMA access will help improve the price of Frax and its stability and will continue to be a core roadmap goal into the future.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/the-four-prices-of-money-and-why
46,"Custodia Bank, a digital-assets-focused bank based in Wyoming, recently faced a setback in its 27-month effort to become a member of the United States Federal Reserve System. The Fed rejected the bank's application, stating that it was ""inconsistent with the required factors under the law"" and citing an insufficient management framework. The bank's CEO, Caitlin Long, stated that the bank actively sought federal regulation and went above and beyond all requirements that apply to traditional banks. The rejection came as a surprise to many in the digital assets industry, as the Fed only issued guidelines for granting master accounts in August of 2022, after it became clear that digital asset banks could have a difficult time receiving one. According to the Fed, institutions that engage in novel activities and for which authorities are still developing appropriate supervisory and regulatory frameworks would undergo a more extensive review. A master account enables a bank to make international transfers and carry out other important functions. Without a master account, digital-assets-focused banks like Custodia and Circle have to rely on intermediaries that can access the payment rails that let traditional banks transfer money to each other. This puts them in a lower tier of banks and also places on-chain funds at a higher risk level. The Fed's rejection of Custodia's application is seen as a major blow to the digital assets industry, and it also raises questions about how quickly Frax will be able to attain a Fed Master account. Despite the rejection, the bank's application for a master account remains pending, and the bank has stated that it intends to continue with its lawsuit against the Kansas City Federal Reserve and re-apply for a master account at the right time. The Federal Reserve, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation issued a joint statement on January 3, highlighting key risks of crypto. According to Caitlin Long, this statement was likely when everything changed for Custodia and the Fed postponed the bank's mid-January check-in due to scheduling conflicts. Despite the rejection, the Fed's policy announcement confirmed Custodia as a bank, a status that was unclear for Wyoming-chartered special purpose depository institutions. The Fed also clarified that banks can provide custody services for assets like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Custodia was one of the first banks in decades to actively try and offer retail and institutional bank accounts without FDIC insurance.  The Fed Master account is extremely desirable for the up and coming stablecoin entrants and it would benefit stablecoin issuers like Circle, Paxos, and Frax by providing them with direct access to the payment rails of the Federal Reserve System. This would allow them to transfer money to other traditional banks, improving the efficiency and speed of transactions, as well as provide access to the discount window in case of a “bank run” caused by asset outflows. While a setback, the fight is far from over. FMA is a dream for every stablecoin issuer, but its not going to manifest without closer ties to federal regulators to ensure the stability and security of the digital assets sector. Despite the recent rejection, Custodia Bank intends to continue with its lawsuit against the Kansas City Federal Reserve and re-apply for a master account at the right time. Frax DAO should be ready for a long fight potentially to get FMA access. The recent implosions of FTX and Luna only further heightened regulators and lawmakers fears about crypto as a whole. Banking is the key place where crypto and TradFi meet. With the DOJ now investigating Silvergate and Custodia being denied, the mood has soured on digital assets. The blow back to the industry will take time to pass, but it doesn’t mean we should stop.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/custodia-bank-denied-federal-reserve

We'll earn badges to prove our might, Showing skills and dedication in sight. A new generation we'll bring and unite, A digital workforce, so full of light! Llama, Llama, what's the date? Late Feb or Early March, it's not too late! And every penny will help us create, A world that's neutral, fair and great. We'll have a contest, what a treat! And interviews, that can't be beat! With phases and partners, it can't be beat, Llama, Llama, can't you see? So come along and follow our lead, To a world where we all succeed! Llama, Llama, this is our creed, Join us now, and take the lead! -Flywheel 2023 :) Minting for the Llamas will take place in late February to early March, with a target release date to be announced. The mint price is set at 0.1E, and all proceeds from the mint and trading fees will go directly to the Llamas’ treasury, which will be used to fund the project’s ecosystem and flywheel. The Llamas’ treasury will be invested in Convex and Curve as the main treasury assets, with the goal of eventually receiving grants and donations from other projects to further increase the flywheel. Governance will be something added later on once the first few phases are completed. Something something veSystem. The Llamas can be thought of as NFTs + badges (POAPs). NFT gets you entry to the social layer, and then the badges distinguish one Llama from the next. It’s a digital reputation system, with different badges having different effects on the yield potential of the Llamas. Some badges will boost the yield for a lifetime, while others will boost it for a limited time before decaying. Third parties will also be able to deploy their own badges in the future, making the badge system similar to Degenscore. The badges will be implemented as ERC-1155s, like POAPs, where 1 badge is issued, and then it can be assigned to different NFTs. The Llamas aim to bring a new level of engagement and reward to the Curve ecosystem and beyond. With their gamified badge system, airdrops, and partnerships with other projects, the Llamas are poised to make an impact on the intersection of DeFi and NFTs in a meaningful way.

48,"Welcome to Frax Check. Your weekly frax vibe check. I am your host Kapital_K and I’m joined our producer extraordinaire Sam. We will be going straight to the source of truth via checking the chain. Before we jump in, please subscribe to the flywheel, it really does help! Please also follow us @flywheelfi on Twitter and tg. This week.. I call this week the “Same Same” week. As the name suggests, this week things are the same same. Frax Check will now break up into two main sections: Product Lines and Profitability. As the name suggests, for the first section, we’re going to go through some of Frax’s products such as FRAX (the stablecoin), frxETH (the stablecoin), FraxBP, FraxLend, FraxSwap, you get the idea. Then we’ll investigate the Profitability across these products. Enough intros, let’s dive in. We start with the flagship product: $FRAX stablecoin. We see the Supply has been holding steady at $1B-ish for the past month or so. Not much to update here. Then obvs, we must check the peg, which got as low as $0.999 with a high of $1.002 for the week. Peg Check = Strong. We then looked at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We received a 0.9984 exchange rate. This is 1 bps lower than last week. Nothing newsworthy this week so moving on we have our Collateralization %. This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. We remained unchanged for the week still at 92%, it’s been this way for a 5 Frax Check now. Following we have the Decentralize %. A month ago, we saw a big reversal jumping but this week, we’re down small from last week by nearly 1%. Still V v v v much bear market vibes across the board when it comes to these two metrics. We want to see the Collat % going back to the low 80s and the Decent % going back to 30s. But I’m hopeful. Okay. Quick summary Health Check. Peg Good. Curve Swap unchanged Collat % could be better been stagnant. Decent % may be in a reversal to the upside but we’re stalling a bit. Next, we have the FraxBP product, which imo is sort of like liquidity as a service. The FraxBP has been holding steady at just about $500M for the past few months. For this week we saw the TVL got to $495.2M, which is 1% more than last week so pretty much unchanged. On the right side we have a new metric I wanted to start looking at which is the volume traded. Since this Frax Check lands perfectly at the end of the month, we have the monthly volume for January at $8.9M which represents about only 1.8% utilization of the nearly $500M TVL. Not great tbh. Not great. But I’m here to report the on-chain data. But also said differently, there’s more than sufficient liquidity to facilitate magnitudes more volume than where we are at now. Following this slide, we have a yield and bribes section, where I look at the current yield being offered to LP into this pool and the bribes Frax Finance had to pay for the yield. You see here that there’s an APR of 2.52% for a $500M pool so the estimated $483k of yield. The quick math is take TVL of $500M, multiply by 2.57%, divide by 365, multiply by 14 days (because Votium epochs are 14 days). Then we compare that to the bribes paid we see if there was any net gain on the bribes. This month so far, we paid $487.5k so rough back of the envelope math says we’re pretty much breakeven for the week. However it’s important to note that Frax Finance’s POL isn’t the only liquidity in the pool so its reward shares are definitely diluted but that’s part of the plan as Frax wants to attract liquidity into the FraxBP. To that end, $377 of liquidity were incentivized by $1 of bribes paid. Now, we march forward to my favorite section of the Frax Check. Ladies and gents, we are… drumroll…. at 89% of the 3pool. The FraxBasedPool is $495.2M versus 3pool's $559.3M. What’s noteworthy is that the FraxBP didn’t gain the TVL but rather 3pool losing its TVL. Note that we are STILL above the Frax3CRV pool!!! Let’s keep the momentum going. Steppingstones, 3Pool next. Moving on, let’s chat about our metapools. Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP. We’re at $66.0M, an increase of 20.7% from last week. We finally broke above the $50M level after 9 Frax Checks. On the following slide, we’ll quickly cover some yields on these metapools as well as the bribes paid. Because there are quite a few stablepair metapools, I’m only looking at the top ones by TVL. We see that BUSD and GUSD is at 1.6% and 2.0% respectively – interesting that these CEX stablecoins aren’t requiring a higher premium. This is below the FraxBP APR, who is LPing in these pools. This could be an interesting on-chain analysis. The alUSD and FRAXBP pair is paying out 8% APR at nearly $11M in TVL. It was 9M last week and was paying 9%+ but a quick bump $2M in two weeks. Honestly, still not too shabby if you believe/trust in alchemix’s mechanism and collateral set. On the bribes front, Frax paid $59.2k for the month of January so far. And if we look at Liquidity per Bribe Dollar, Frax was able to pull in $1,114 per $1 of bribes spent. So, c’mon people, we got some yield and liquidity for your community, so come and get some! Any projects out there looking to work with the Metapool, please join the Flywheel TG chat and DM any of the hosts for assistance. Also one quick note, we also have an additional $16.8M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. That is a nice jump of 6.3% over last week. Similarly, I wanted to look at some of the yield and the bribes for these non-stable metapool pairs. For this category, I went the other route and sorted by APR. We see here that ALCX-FRAXBP is offering a whopping 63% APR! Wooh! Then we have the usual flywheel suspects of CVX, cvxCRV, and cvxFXS at a range between 26 - 35%. But we got a new contender throwback with Ohm+FraxBP paying 40%! On the bribes side, Frax paid $34.7k so far in January and the liquidity incented is $480 of liquidity per $1 of bribe spent. So, adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $82.8M of liquidity paired against FraxBP – up 17.4% this week. Summary time. Liquidity Check. FraxBP is 495.2M which is 89% of 3Pool. The MetaPool is at $66M for stable pairs and $16.8M for non-stable pairs. And TVL of All pairs (stables + non-stables) are at $82.8M. Next, we have our FrxETH segment. We start by checking the frxETH supply. As always, it’s up only! The count is at 81,271. And look at that chart, I know you can’t read it but just appreciate the verticalness off that graph. +9.7%. Hot. Let’s look at where the frxETHs are hanging out! As a reminder, You can stake your frxETH into the sfrxETH vault to earn the native ETH staking yield. And in that vault we see that 49.6%, (pretty much unchanged from last week) of the frxETH is chilling and stacking ETH earning a nice 7.18% APR. The other place you can take your frxETH is to the curve pool of frxETH/ETH, where you can join 48.7% (up 1% from last week) of the frxETH supply earning 8.2% APR in CVX, CRV, FXS. The remainder 1.7% is floating in the ether somewhere. But enough talk of the supply and the yield, let’s get down to the peg. Peg check here is AS strong AS it could be, you see the price delta at 0.0001 between frxETH and ETH. But, we obvs have to go into the market and check this ourselves and you see here that I tried to swap a 3500 frxETH which is roughly the amount of the largest frxETH holder and I get an exchange rate of 0.9985. That’s not too shabby, down nearly 4 bps from last week. And also let’s just note the TVL here, we broke $100M last week, and now we’re at $122M. 9 SOLID FIGURES baby. So far so good, let’s see how we stack up with the others. Here we layout the LSD market landscape. Obvs, we have Lido in the lead with 29% of the market but you can see here that Frax REMAINED the highest 30-day delta in the group, at +73% so far. The massive pump deposits this week led to a 10% increase in market share for frxETH, which sits at 0.41%. And thus we have our first flippening with us overtaking Ankr Staking. It’s not official-official yet since there’s a 1 week or so delay of validator set up, but next week I’m sure we’ll overtake Stakewise and be in the top 3! Let’s keep fighting the good fight! On the yield landscape, frxETH pretty much dominates with a 7.18% and the closest competitor is Stakewise at 4.91%. We are the best game in town so come get some of this gud gud! Peg check strong. Curve swap strong. Count up-only. Staked % healthy. Next we have our FraxLend section. We’ve snatched a TVL of $233M with $50.5M in borrowed FRAX. The charts I like to look at are the Collateral Value and the Supply Value. These are great proxies for trust in the product. A good confidence check and you see the graphs are trending up and to the right. Following that I like to check the utilization %, which for me is how much of the total supply has been borrowed, and we’re at a 81.5% utilization rate across all the lending pairs. This is a slightly different way of looking at utilization rates, but I prefer it. Currently, there are 12 pairs being offered on FraxLend but more and more are being added. Also take a look at the current Supply APY for sfrxETH/FRAX pair. A whopping 8.96% on pristine sfrxETH collateral. I would probably park FRAX here. Be sure to listen to our Governance Roundup to get any alpha on any future pairs. There’s another cool visualization of the loan health that I want to highlight. The largest position on FraxLend is nearly 21M FRAX being borrowed against 104M of CRV, as you can see the position is quite healthy, and from a quick glance, most positions on fraxlend are quite healthy. The last leg of the DeFi Trinity: the DEX aka FraxSwap. Per DeFi Llama, the TVL is $65.7M with a 147.5M monthly volume so far for January. I just took the Monthly volume divided by the TVL to get a utilization rate of 218%. Granted the volume this past week or two or three has been picking up so if you look at December, which looks to be about a third so utilization rate could be in the 70%s, but that’s still pretty good. Now there is a slight discrepancy between DeFi Llama’s reported TVL and the one on Frax Facts but that’s because of the massive $85M FraxFPI pool that DeFi Llama isn’t including in the TVL. Finally, let’s jump into our profitability section starting an overview of the AMO holdings. We have a grand total of $1039.0M across all the AMOs. This is largely unchanged over last week with a mere 9M gain across the two AMOs — Curve & Investor. The Curve AMO is at 712M, Liquidity $80M, Lending $70M, and Investor 177M. Things are quiet on the AMO front. Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. For the month of January, we have $1.17M in revenue and $1.7M in expenses. As you can see, most of our revenue comes from CRV rewards, magnitudes larger than the CVX and FXS rewards. With a net loss of $540k to start our 2023. We have a long way to climb to get over this profitability hurdle but it’s growth time so we gotta pay to play the game.  Quick summary money check. AMO holdings was $1031.9M, +0.0% WoW.

50,"It’s funny how we divide politically but agree on the same subjects.  Today’s digital money easier than ever to use, but it almost is exclusively owned and operated by corporate entities. Large banks and Big Tech (Cashapp, Venmo, Square) control the rapidly growing digital money space. It seems so easy though, with a smartphone you don’t have to carry a bulky wallet anymore. Practically every store has a POS system for taking credit card or debit payments and some business refuse to take coins and bills due to the extra cost of storing, transferring, and counting.   Digital money forces us to ask key questions of our relationship with the state and private businesses. Do we as a society want to turn over our entire digital money existence to a private group of multi-national corporations who have their shareholder value first? What does it say when a company like FTX goes under while in effect acting like a modern bank? Should entities or persons be frozen and kicked off platforms for holding politically distasteful opinions? Can we trust multiple large organizations to keep our data safe and not fall to hacking attacks? In crypto, it’s the rising dominance of centralized stablecoins, USDC & USDT, which provide a regulatory backdoor into immutable, censorship resistant networks. Additionally, this says nothing of their business model which render them bank-like through the issuance of cash liabilities.  In reply we wonder, “But what about the simplicity and peg tightness of USDC? It’s so good. Why should I use a different stable with lower liquidity? How do I bridge the gap between TradFi and DeFi?” Stables attract demand in crypto due to their perceived safety and ability to be redeemed. They just work for most everyone.  Bitcoin as “digital cash” in its early years was supposed to replace any need for bank/corporate money. The panacea to Big Banking’s contagion. A refusal of Big Tech. Bitcoin has and continues to finding “mass adoption” by rarely being used as a payment method.  When 1’s & 0’s flow through digital economic rails as money, there will always be some or all concession to the state. Our footprint is pervasive, grows exponentially and is insatiable for more data. Like a water jug that overflows faster as its drained, torrenting waves of data are caught, saved, and eternally analyzed no matter the network. Crypto may sever the chain of custody for OpSec demanding transactions, but a typical user journey starts and ends with a Centralized exchange.  The only place we can find true immutable, censorship resistant privacy is with good-old greenbacks. Paper notes and coin bullion are “checks on the balance of power” as Brett Scott describes. Cash needs to exist to keep Big Banking and Tech’s power at bay. Cash isn’t a replacement for digital money, rather is a bastion of personal freedom, the core thesis of our liberal societies. Newer variants of the 10,000 year old invention are weakened in some respect when copper wires transmit value.  Cloudmoney is at its core, a call for open, transparent discussion on the role of the state and businesses in our lives. Its stories provide view into the mechanisms of modern money, finance and the power derived from those who control it. His use of metaphors humanizes many of the opaque technical concepts like blockchain, proof of work consensus, Ethereum and stablecoins.

51,"It has one of the most confusing, but novel 2 token mechanisms, WUSD and GLO, in crypto at the moment. WUSD charges a 1% wrapping fee that is used to buy GLO. Unwrapping is free. So what’s the difference between DAI, Frax, and WUSD? Well, the team was nice enough to provide a “Memeparison” Moving past WUSD is where things start to get complicated, or at least turns into a honeypot. First, looking at the chart below what is the first thing you think of? The standard play for any new protocol is to: 1. Issue a token on a fixed distribution schedule 2. Incentivize liquidity for Pool 2 (token + ETH in LP) 3. Hope it doesn’t get dumped to zero. If you’ve been in crypto for longer than 5 minutes you’ve seen 1000 charts like the one below. Token price starts out nice and high due to low liquidity. As time goes on, it gets dumped to zero as more and more tokens are issued. The protocol fails if it can’t gain enough traction to ever grow faster than emissions. Token price eventually goes to 0. The only way to get credit is if certain actions are completed by users as a whole. If no one uses WUSD, GLO is useless and can’t be sold. Whales can buy a ton of GLO, but they can’t sell until they satisfy the conditions to earn credit. There are three ways to earn credit: Minting WUSD. Everytime at least 100K has been wrapped, all preexisting wrappers earn 1% credit and the epoch advances. It doesn’t matter if 100k or 10m is minted at once, as excess minting is counted only in the current epoch.Since launch WUSD has been at Epoch 0, with only 44k WUSD minted at this time.  Running a front end. Devs who want to support WUSD can set up their own front ends, similar to how Liquity operates. Credit is issued based on the total volume of WUSD minted. The front end earns 1% of all mint volume as credit. Providing GLO-USDT and/or GLO-USDC liquidity on Uniswap v3. (changing soon) Fun, right? I have no idea if this model can succeed. DeFi is all about incentives and WUSD/GLOs are opaque in the sense that they are new and no one knows how to play the meta game yet. Right now, is there a reason to mint WUSD other than get up to 2 GLO to unlock some bags? Yes, the wrapped fiat has value and can be used to transact once Curve LPs are created. Is this enough to kickstart growth and bring in new liquidity for WUSD? Maybe? I don’t know.  We have Curve pools. WUSD should pair with FRAX and incentivize growth through Frax’s flywheel.  If the LP rewards are high enough, that will bring in lots of liquidity to WUSD and unlock GLO.One thing WUSD could have done before launch was to distribute a few hundred GLO to the Frax protocol in return for future rewards. Bribes for bribes. This should be a good lesson for other new projects looking to kickstart their growth in the future.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/wusd-and-glo-an-introduction-to-cryptos
52,"In the podcast we talked in detail about two of the points that Alex did answer: DAOs are unincorporated associations for purposes of California state law, and therefore can be sued, in California, pursuant to FRCP 17. DAOs are particularly susceptible to alternative forms of service because of their unique organizational structure. One thing we have in America is a lot of lawyers looking for a cut of fees from litigation. Judge Orrick’s decision was chum in the water as it creates a “Catch-22 for DAO members” where they must “identify themselves and participate in the defense of the DAO,” or “stay anonymous and risk being liable for a default judgment against the DAO.” Now switch porn with “illegal securities/commodities” and you can see the potential oncoming tsunami of litigation against DAOs. Instead of IPs, firms can go after wallets, forcing exchanges to doxx or just using services like Chainalysis to find public information. After getting a summary judgment when no one shows up to fight the DAO, the firms can then go after the wallets they were able to doxx and sue them for every penny they have. Unincorporated associations (DAOs) if set up incorrectly will not protect their members against these sharks. One of the shining achievements of liberal societies was the enshrining of limited liability into a company. This separates the actions of the company from the personal lives of the employees and owners. It’s a “key feature of American capitalism” Alex says. The first thing a DAO should do is incorporate. Don’t skimp on this part. Spend more than 5 minutes figuring out jurisdiction and structure. If you don’t, it's just leaving the door open for sharks to bite you in the ass later on. Go in with the assumption that you are going to get sued at a later date and understand what legal protections the DAO can provide. Another big thing all DAOs should have is indemnification for all participants. This just means the DAO will have legal standing to use its treasury against any attacks on members, developers, or other people connected to the DAO. Part of the reason the CTFC issue has been so challenging is that Ooki DAO provides no indemnity and cannot use any treasury funds in its defense. Above all, being anonymous is preferred. There are obvious risks in making oneself public when there are millions of dollars at stake. Without protections provided by the DAO, the only way to keep safe is to be unknown. The incentives are all messed up… for now. Time will tell how regulators will act on this in the future. In crypto everything is a security… until it’s not. Armchair lawyers on crypto twitter (especially the Bitcoin maxis) love to throw Howey and the dreaded “S” word around, but they routinely miss what the case actually said and how it's interpreted. Quoting from the Howey decision… The legal issue, in this case, turns upon a determination of whether, under the circumstances, the land sales contract, the warranty deed, and the service contract together constitute an “investment contract” within the meaning of § 2(1). In other words, an investment contract, for purposes of the Securities Act, means a contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person invests his money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the efforts of the promoter or a third party . . .. The transactions in this case clearly involve investment contracts, as so defined. The respondent companies are offering something more than fee simple interests in land, something different from a farm or orchard coupled with management services. They are offering an opportunity to contribute money and to share in the profits of a large citrus fruit enterprise managed and partly owned by respondents. The arrangement is the investment contract, not the assets. Neither the orange groves, trees, or the oranges themselves are securities. Howey is about investment contracts aka arrangements. Many investments are not securities, like buying and selling oranges, which have variable prices. Blockchains are arguably like the orange groves, whereas property can fluctuate in value, and like the trees it can create new property which has value. SEC Commissioner Hester Pierce explained, “when we think about a cryptoasset as being a security what we’re doing is we’re saying it’s being sold as part of an investment contract. It doesn’t mean that the asset itself necessarily has to be a security. It means that it was being sold as a security.” I’m just speculating here, but part of the reason the SEC hasn’t made clear statements about what is and isn't’ a security is a result of them wanting to retain broad ambiguity, while still only pursuing cases where a clear arrangement can be discerned. The SEC isn’t calling airline miles or loyalty points securities, even though they are bought and sold on secondary markets. Money changing hands is not the issue, nor is a distributed, shared, programmable database. Congress’ lack of action to clarify this point or define certain digital assets as “not securities” is the real problem we face. The SEC pursues enforcement actions ex post facto. It’s not a preventative body, nor does it make the law. Probably not. Loans are a promise to pay back at some point in the future. But what if you don’t have to pay back the loan? Is it still a promise? Alex doesn’t think so and neither does the code as used in DeFi today. If you don’t pay back the loan, it stays open until repaid or liquidated. In this case the “loan” is more akin to an option. You are entering into a contract to receive one asset for posting up another. The option has no expiration, but it does decay and can be “exercised” if necessary.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/3-big-takeaways-from-interview-with
53,"Welcome to Frax Check. Your weekly frax vibe check. I am your host Kapital_K and I’m joined by my co-host DeFi Dave and our producer extraordinaire Sam. We will be going straight to the source of truth via checking the chain. Before we jump in, please subscribe to the flywheel, it really does help! Please also follow us @flywheelfi on Twitter and tg. This week.. I call this week the “The New New” week. And it has nothing to do with Frax itself but at Frax Check we have a whole new revamp and renovation. We got the new branding, new colorway, and of course new segments for you guys.  Frax Check will now break up into two main sections: Product Lines and Profitability. As the name suggests, for the first section, we’re going to go through some of Frax’s products such as FRAX (the stablecoin), frxETH (the stablecoin), FraxBP, FraxLend, FraxSwap, you get the idea. Then we’ll investigate the Profitability across these products. Enough intros, let’s dive in. We start with the flagship product: $FRAX stablecoin. We see the Supply has been holding steady at $1B-ish for the past month or so. Not much to update here. Then obvs, we have to check the peg, which got as low as $0.999 with a high of $1.004 for the week. I guess some folks thought $FRAX could also pump. Regardless of speculation, Peg Check = Strong. We then looked at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We received a 0.9985 exchange rate. This is 2 bps better than last week. Nothing newsworthy this week so moving on we have our Collateralization %. This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. We remained unchanged for the week still at 92%, it’s been this way for a 4 Frax Check now. Following we have the Decentralize %. Three weeks ago, we saw a big reversal jumping but this week, we’re unchanged from last week’s 22.5%. Still V v v v much bear market vibes across the board when it comes to these two metrics. We want to see the Collat % going back to the low 80s and the Decent % going back to 30s. But I’m hopeful. Okay. Quick summary Health Check. Peg Good. Curve Swap unchanged Collat % could be better been stagnant. Decent % may be in a reversal to the upside but we’re stalling a bit. Next, we have the FraxBP product, which imo is sort of like liquidity as a service. The FraxBP has been holding steady at just about $500M for the past few months. For this week we saw the TVL got to $489.7M, which is $200k more than last week so pretty much unchanged. On the right side we have a new metric I wanted to start looking at which is the volume traded. To estimate the monthly volume, I take the avg of 7 days of volume then multiply that by 30. So for the month of Jan, we’re at $5.1M which represents about only 1% utilization of the nearly $500M TVL. Not great tbh. Not great. But I’m here to report the on-chain data. But also said differently, there’s more than sufficient liquidity to facilitate magnitudes more volume than where we are at now.  Following this slide, we have a yield and bribes section, where I look at the current yield being offered to LP into this pool and the bribes Frax Finance had to pay for the yield. You see here that there’s an APR of 2.57% for a $500M pool so the estimated $492k of yield. The quick math is take TVL of $500M, multiply by 2.57%, divide by 365, multiply by 14 days (because Votium epochs are 14 days). Then we compare that to the bribes paid we see if there was any net gain on the bribes. This month so far we paid $487.5k so rough back of the envelope math says we’re pretty much breakeven for the week. However it’s important to note that Frax Finance’s POL isn’t the only liquidity in the pool so its reward shares are definitely diluted but that’s part of the plan as Frax wants to attract liquidity into the FraxBP. To that end, $377 of liquidity were incentivized by $1 of bribes paid.  Now, we march forward to my favorite section of the Frax Check. Ladies and gents, we are… again… at 86% of the 3pool, aka we’re unchanged since last week. The FraxBasedPool is $489.7M versus 3pool's $571.9M. Note that we are STILL above the Frax3CRV pool!!! Let’s keep the momentum going. Steppingstones, 3Pool next. Moving on, let’s chat about our metapools. Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP. We’re at $54.7M, an increase of 11% from last week. We finally broke above the $50M level after 9 Frax Checks.  On the following slide, we’ll quickly cover some yields on these metapools as well as the bribes paid. Because there are quite a few stablepair metapools, I’m only looking at the top ones by TVL. We see that BUSD and GUSD is at 2.5% and 2.2% respectively – interesting that these CEX stablecoins aren’t requiring a higher premium. The alUSD and FRAXBP pair is paying out 9.1% APR at nearly $9M in TVL. Honestly, not too shabby if you believe/trust in alchemix’s mechanism and collateral set.  On the bribes front, Frax paid $59.2k for the month of January so far. And if we look at Liquidity per Bribe Dollar, Frax was able to pull in $923 per $1 of bribes spent. So, c’mon people, we got some yield and liquidity for your community, so come and get some! Any projects out there looking to work with the Metapool, please join the Flywheel TG chat and DM any of the hosts for assistance. Also one quick note, we also have an additional $15.8M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. That is a nice jump of 5% over last week.  Similarly, I wanted to look at some of the yield and the bribes for these non-stable metapool pairs. For this category, I went the other route and sorted by APR. We see here that ALCX-FRAXBP is offering a whopping 75% APR! Wooh! Then we have the usual flywheel suspects of CVX, cvxCRV, and cvxFXS at a range between 26 - 35%. On the bribes side, Frax paid $34.7k so far in January and the liquidity incented is $455 of liquidity per $1 of bribe spent. So, adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $70.5M of liquidity paired against FraxBP – up 9.6% this week. Summary time. Liquidity Check. FraxBP is 489.7M which is 86% of 3Pool. The MetaPool is at $49.3M for stable pairs and $15.0M for non-stable pairs. And TVL of All pairs (stables + non-stables) are at $64.3M. Next, we have our FrxETH segment. We start by checking the frxETH supply. As always, it’s up only! The count is at 74,073. And look at that chart, I know you can’t read it but just appreciate the verticalness off that graph. +17.7%. Hot. Let’s look at where the frxETHs are hanging out! As a reminder, You can stake your frxETH into the sfrxETH vault to earn the native ETH staking yield. And in that vault we see that 47.8%, (nearly 10% increase from last week) of the frxETH is chilling and stacking ETH earning a nice 7.81% APR. The other place you can take your frxETH is to the curve pool of frxETH/ETH, where you can join 48.2% (down 9% from last week) of the frxETH supply earning 9.1% APR in CVX, CRV, FXS. The remainder is floating in the ether somewhere. But enough talk of the supply and the yield, let’s get down to the peg. Peg check here is strong you see the price delta is only 0.0004 between frxETH and ETH. But, we obvs have to go into the market and check this ourselves and you see here that I tried to swap a 3500 frxETH which is roughly the amount of the largest frxETH holder and I get an exchange rate of 0.9988. That’s not too shabby, up nearly 9 bps from last week. And also let’s just note the TVL here, we broke $100M, and we’re at $115M. 9 SOLID FIGURES baby. So far so good, let’s see how we stack up with the others. Here we layout the LSD market landscape. Obvs, we have Lido in the lead with 29% of the market but you can see here that Frax REMAINED the highest 30-day delta in the group, at +60% so far. The massive pump deposits this week led to a 15% increase in market share for frxETH, which sits at 0.37%. And thus we have our first flippening with us overtaking Ankr Staking. It’s not official-official yet since there’s a 1 week or so delay of validator set up, but next week I’m sure we’ll overtake Stakewise and be in the top 3! Let’s keep fighting the good fight!  On the yield landscape, frxETH pretty much dominates with a 30D APY of 7.88% and the closest competitor is Stakewise at 5.78%. We are the best game in town so come get some of this gud gud! Peg check strong. Curve swap strong. Count up-only. Staked % healthy. Next we have our FraxLend section. We’ve snatched a TVL of $225M with $46M in borrowed FRAX. The charts I like to look at are the Collateral Value and the Supply Value. These are great proxies for trust in the product. A good confidence check and you see the graphs are trending up and to the right. Following that I like to check the utilization %, which for me is how much of the total supply has been borrowed, and we’re at a 75% utilization rate across all the lending pairs. This is a slightly different way of looking at utilization rates, but I prefer it. Currently, there are 12 pairs being offered on FraxLend but more and more are being added. Be sure to listen to our Governance Roundup to get any alpha on any future pairs. There’s another cool visualization of the loan health that I want to highlight. The largest position on FraxLend is nearly 21M FRAX being borrowed against 104M of CRV, as you can see the position is quite healthy, and from a quick glance, most positions on fraxlend are quite healthy.  The last leg of the DeFi Trinity: the DEX aka FraxSwap. Per DeFi Llama, the TVL is $67M with a 147.5M monthly volume so far for January. I just took the Monthly volume divided by the TVL to get a utilization rate of 218%. Granted the volume this past week or two or three has been picking up so if you look at December, which looks to be about a third so utilization rate could be in the 70%s, but that’s still pretty good. Now there is a slight discrepancy between DeFi Llama’s reported TVL and the one on Frax Facts but that’s because of the massive $85M FraxFPI pool that DeFi Llama isn’t including in the TVL. Finally, let’s jump into our profitability section starting an overview of the AMO holdings.  We have a grand total of $1031.9M across all the AMOs. This is largely unchanged over last week with a mere 1M gain across the four AMOs. The Curve AMO is at 710M, Liquidity $80M, Lending $70M, and Investor 170M. Things are quiet on the AMO front. Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. For the month of January, we have $950k in revenue and $1.7M in expenses. As you can see, most of our revenue comes from CRV rewards, magnitudes larger than the CVX and FXS rewards. With a net loss of $760k to start our 2023. We have a long way to climb to get over this profitability hurdle but it’s growth time so we gotta pay to play the game.  Quick summary money check. AMO holdings was $1031.9M, +0.0% WoW. Profitability, for January so far is subpar but I remain hopeful until the end of the month! ~~~~ ~~~~ Listen to Flywheelpod Wherever You Listen to Podcasts: Spotify ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ ~~~~ Not financial or tax advice.

54,"DeFi Dave also published what could be a seminal partnership in the making and yet another cog in the growing Frax flywheel. Eigenlayer leverages Ethereum network security through restocking, a process that lends it to other growing networks so they don’t have to rely on bootstrapping their security. We think its important because it could generate extra yield for sFrxETH stakers, and it could eventually make Frax one of the core layers on which protocol build for the future. Lots to explore here and we are excited to see where this potential partnership could go.  Crypto markets are mostly free, open, and without capital controls. The US dollars ability to retain value across time and its near infinite liquidity makes it the singular choice for crypto trading. Increased dollar dominance only further strengthens my personal belief that most people prefer the best money (USD) and in an open and free environment they will use no substitutes. What this means is that decentralized apps will be able to interact with the veFPIS contract and enable new features like borrowing and leverage. In the event of liquidation, the veFPIS lock will remain active, and the rights to the tokens will be transferred to the protocol or different users. This functionality is missing from the original veCRV/FXS contracts and is the core reason why Convex exists in the first place. Unfortunately, this improvement is not available for veFXS holders as the contract is not upgradable. Another reason for the whitelisting ability is to enable “slashing,” or penalties against one’s stake for malicious voting. veFPIS holders will vote on CPI gauge weights as their primary function to control the growth of FPI. If a voter is providing malicious votes, their stake can be slashed. There’s so much alpha in the Frax TG, all you have to do is ask. On Sunday, January 15, I asked a simple question of Sam, “Wen FrxETH base pool.” Alpha ensued. Sam K explained that a “FrxETH” base pool was already in the works and that they didn’t need Curve’s help to create it. The biggest revelation was that FrxETH would most likely stand alone and would not be paired against ETH. The incentive system would work similar to how FraxBP currently works. Frax will set aside a portion of its CRV voting power and use to to vote on FrxETH paired LPs relative to the total distribution across all pools. So if the stETH/FrxETH pool is 50% of all FrxETH liquidity on Curve, Frax will use 50% of its voting power to incentivize that pool. While not specifically a “base pool” this incentive system would serve the purpose of creating new FrxETH pair liquidity and further splitting sFrxETH/FrxETH un the form of new use cases. Once Shanghai opens up there won’t be a need for regular ETH anymore. FrxETH will hopefully serve as the base layer asset for all ETH, it's all part of Frax’s plan for global domination as the base liquidity layer for all of crypto. An intrepid follower asked Sam about beating CPI Sam dropped some alpha around FrxETH decentralization in LobsterDao Aura wars up ahead? ",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/frax-in-review-23-jan-2023
55,"The advent of Bitcoin kicked off a decentralized security “space race” and we aren’t talking about going to the moon here. In just a decade, cryptoeconomic security has transitioned from the consensus layer all the way to the protocol layer. Bitcoin showed how transactional security could be enforced in an adversarial environment while Ethereum would later enable meaningful applications to implicitly gain the security guarantees of the underlying network. . The problem with network security is that it tends to follow power laws and in that regard, Bitcoin and Ethereum dominate the areas of hash rates and stake values. New networks are forced to sell their soul (to more often than not mercenary actors) in order to bootstrap enough security guarantees. Building your own trust network from the ground up is costly and resource intensive, limiting potential innovation. But what if there was a way to bring the security of Ethereum to not just applications and middleware but to *anything* that requires a trustless network? Enter EigenLayer, a general-purpose market for cryptoeconomic security that connects applications, middleware, bridges, data availability, rollup sequencers, etc. to Ethereum validators. The exchange that happens is that these decentralized protocols and networks outsource “trust” to Ethereum validators that “restake'' their ETH. Restaking is the rehypothecation of staked Ethereum by adding extra slashing conditions. In return, restakers earn extra yield for their services for enabling trust within a decentralized system. Rehypothecation is a common practice in banks where collateral held as an asset on a balance sheet is used to take a new liability and in return the original collateral holder receives favorable terms such as a lower borrowing rate. Ultimately, EigenLayer creates a whole new landscape of ripe opportunities throughout the Ethereum stack. Networks experimenting with different VMs can utilize EigenLayer to bootstrap liquidity, data availability on-chain becomes a real possibility, and applications can focus on just building the best product possible instead of worrying how decentralized their trust network is. The two pillars that underlie EigenLayer’s system are pooled security and free-market agency. Ethereum validators can ‘opt-in’ to EigenLayer’s smart contracts and agree to new slashing conditions in order to obtain additional yield, and in return, EigenLayer receives the right to withdraw the staked ETH in case penalties are incurred by the validator. While Ethereum validators can have up to 50% of their stake slashed for penalties on mainnet, by opting into EigenLayer, validators give EigenLayer’s smart contracts permission to withdraw the remaining 50%. Free-market dynamics allow clients (protocols, networks, etc.) and validators the choice of either how much security they desire to receive or how much security they want to supply. By allowing protocols to decide who has permission to secure their network and, conversely, validators to choose which protocols they want to bootstrap, a competitive market is be created that selects the highest quality clients and best performing validators. And in time, the pooling of security that is facilitated by EigenLayer liberates protocols from the constraints of worrying about decentralization by infusing the robust security of the Ethereum network in a seamless manner. FrxETH is the native ETH LSD token of the Frax protocol which has had explosive growth since its inception. A key reason for this is it’s two-token system that consists of FrxETH (a ERC-20 wrapper that is the equivalent of WETH) and sFrxETH (a ERC-4626 vault that earns validator yield). This LSD design has proven to be one of the most thoughtful ones live today and Eigenlayer presents the ideal opportunity to extend FrxETH’s revenue streams so stakers can earn additional yield. In order for FrxETH to properly be integrated into EigenLayer, I propose the following: Create new ERC-4262 vaults (for example, esFrxETH) for those who want to participate in EigenLayer validators. More research needs to be done in how to safely and effectively manage this part of the stack but this will offer stakers optionality that would not exist with any other LSD. Develop a governance process in deciding which EigenLayer clients to support. Since it is an open market of networks to choose from, the Frax community can decide which ones to secure. This can be similar to how gauges are decided. Since every network is different, FrxETH can develop a methodology of tranches for each network that is supported, allowing stakers to optimize for yield and risk management. By creating separate vaults for each EigenLayer network, FrxETH will be able to cater to stakers who want to take on more risk as well as protect stakers who only want to secure mainnet. Furthermore, EigenLayer provides FrxETH the opportunity to forge deeper partnerships with protocols and networks before they even launch a token. Just imagine, at first Frax can guarantee cryptoeconomic trust at a network level and then when the client is ready provide cryptoeconomic incentives at the application level to ensure liquidity. From a security perspective, an example of a network in the future that esFrxETH can bootstrap is Frax itself. In the past, there have been mentions of a potential Fraxchain or Frax rollup which would act as a settlement layer of any Frax stablecoin (FRAX, FPI, FrxETH) transactions. Instead of seeking outside sequencers, Frax can insource them from FrxETH. While developments like this is some time away, it is still important to consider the potential and benefits of such an integration. EigenLayer provides a way for protocols, networks, systems, etc. to outsource their security and Ethereum validators a way to maximize their stake all while increasing the vigorousness of the entire Ethereum network stack. EigenLayer particularly presents a unique opportunity to LSDs to earn more yield on top of what they receive from securing mainnet. A main issue for most LSDs though is they need to be able to separate the tranches of risk which is likely to become a particularly tricky issue, especially if resources are being spent to establish sufficient liquidity for the primary mainnet LSD. Yet, because of how FrxETH is structured, Frax does not need to worry about fracturing liquidity since its incentivizations efforts are only directed at the FrxETH-ETH pair on Curve. All and all, EigenLayer and Frax is poised to make for a fruitful collaboration that ultimately makes the trust and security of Ethereum more robustful as well as economically efficient to do so.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/eigenlayer-and-frax-the-next-generation
56,"Welcome to Frax Check. Your weekly frax vibe check. I am your host Kapital_K and I’m joined by my co-host DeFi Dave and our producer extraordinaire Sam. We will be going straight to the source of truth via checking the chain. Before we jump in, please subscribe to the flywheelcrypto, it really does help! Please also follow us @flywheelcrypto on Twitter and tg. This week.. I call this week the “Just Keep Swimming” week. I know the price action has been cray cray this week but, on this show, we don’t talk about that and I’m here to keep us grounded. So, let’s just keep on swimming, and dive into our regular programming. As always we start with the Peg. We saw it get as low as $0.998 with a high of $1.002 for the week. Peg Check = Strong. We then looked at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We received a 0.9983 exchange rate. This is 4 bps better than last week. So, both metrics pretty much unchanged or slight improvement. Moving on we have our Collateralization %. This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. We remained unchanged for the week still at 92%, it’s been this way for a 2-3 Frax Check now. Following we have the Decentralize %. Two weeks ago, we saw a big reversal jumping by more than 55% but this week, we’re up 2.2% from last week’s 22.55 and sitting pretty at 23.0%. Still V v v v much bear market vibes across the board when it comes to these two metrics. We want to see the Collat % going back to the low 80s and the Decent % going back to 30s. But I’m hopeful. Okay. Quick summary Health Check. Peg Good. Curve Swap unchanged Collat % could be better been stagnant. Decent % may be in a reversal to the upside. Next, we have our FrxETH segment. As always, we check the peg. Peg check here is strong you see the price delta is only 0.0011 between frxETH and ETH – slight deviation from last week. But, we obvs have to go into the market and check this ourselves and you see here that I tried to do a 3500 ETH swap which is roughly the amount of the largest frxETH holder and I get an exchange rate of 0.9979. That’s not too shabby, down about 7 bps from last week. Also, last week we had 51.2% of the frxETH staked in the Curve pool, and now we’re up small to 53.0% of the supply inside curve. And also let’s just note the TVL in here, we’re about to break $100M. 9 FIGURES baby. The APY as per Convex is at 6.5% projected versus 6.69% for sfrxETH. The market here is so dam efficient, I love it. Let’s see what the count looks like this week. The count is at 62,954. And look at that chart, I know you can’t read it but just appreciate the verticalness off that graph. +24.2%. Hot. Last week I said the LSD narrative floating around is going to be a catalyst for more deposits and lo’ behold. We up another casual 12k ETH deposits. I don’t always pat myself on the back but sorta called this one. On the staked side we see that the staking rate dropped by 9% this week down to 43.5% from 47.8%. The sfrxETH is earning a cool rate of 6.69% -- very nice. We have a new slide here where we layout the LSD market landscape. Obvs, we have Lido in the lead with 29% of the market but you can see here that Frax REAMAINED the highest 30-day delta in the group, at +43% so far. The massive pump deposits this week led to a 23% increase in market share for frxETH, which sits at 0.32%. We boutta’ flip Ankr Staking fr fr. Let’s keep fighting the good fight and pump up these rookie numbers! Now, let’s do a quick summary check. Peg check strong. Curve swap strong. Count up-only. Staked % healthy. Let's jump into the AMO Holdings. We have a grand total of $1030.9M across all the AMOs. This was a good up move of 2% from last week. With the market up and bumping, obvs the Investor AMO got a nice boost, up $10M and the Liquidity AMO got a nice boost too up $12M-ish. The Curve & Lending AMO remained the same so things are quiet on the AMO front. Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. For the month of January so far we have $720k in revenue and $1.17M in expenses. As you can see, most of our revenue comes from CRV rewards, magnitudes larger than the CVX and FXS rewards. With a net loss of $450k to start our 2023. We have another bribe to pay next week and then hopefully 2 rounds of rewards so we just may end the month down small or fingers crossed, break even.  Quick summary money check. AMO holdings was $1030.9M, +2.0% WoW. Profitability, for January so far is subpar but I remain hopeful until the end of the month! Here's my favorite section of the Frax Check. The Liquidity Check. Do you guys remember the theme of this week, it was “Just Keep Swimming”. Well, in this specific segment, we SWIMMING up baby. We’re up 4% pushing us solidly into the mid 80s and we’re rocking a strong 86% of the 3pool. The FraxBasedPool is $489.5M versus 3pool's $569.1M. The basedpool is up small 0.1% for the week. But what’s important here is that the 3POOL went DOWN by a good chunk almost $30M. Note that we are STILL above the Frax3CRV pool!!! Let’s keep the momentum going. Stepping stones, 3Pool next. Moving on, let’s chat about our metapools. Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP. We’re at $49.3M, an increase of 8.3% from last week. But we just can’t seem to break above the $50M level for the past 8 Frax Checks. C’mon people, we got some yield and liquidity for your community, so come and get some! Any projects out there looking to work with the Metapool, please join the Flywheel TG chat and DM any of the hosts for assistance. Also one quick note, we also have an additional $15M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. That is a bigly jump of 28% over last week. Glad some of y’all at home are joining us for this sweet-sweet yield and liquidity or it could just be the market pumping so these TVLs are up. I choose to believe that we’re making an impact so let’s go with the former. So, adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $64.3M of liquidity paired against FraxBP – up 12.4% this week. Summary time. Liquidity Check. FraxBP is 489.5M which is 86% of 3Pool. The MetaPool is at $49.3M for stable pairs and $15.0M for non-stable pairs. And TVL of All pairs (stables + non-stables) are at $64.3M. Lastly, the main reason why we track all of this is to make sure the FRAX supply could grow as big as possible. This week we're at 1.018B, which is unchanged for the last 3 weeks. We’re flirting with that 9-figure digit line, and I don’t like it. We need to keep our eyes on the prize and grow this number.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/just-keep-swimming-fraxcheck-22
57,"Welcome to Frax Check. Your weekly frax vibe check. I am your host Kapital_K and I’m joined by my co-host DeFi Dave and our producer extraordinaire Sam. We will be going straight to the source of truth via checking the chain. Before we jump in, please subscribe to the flywheelpod, it really does help! Please also follow us @flywheelpod on Twitter and tg. This week.. I call this week the “Up Small” week. As the name suggests, we’re pretty much “up small” across the board this week. Will think of a more creative name next week, hopefully some fun things happen. Let's begin our regular programming with the Peg. We saw it get as low as $0.998 with a high of $1.001 for the week. Peg Check = Strong. We then looked at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We received a 0.9978 exchange rate. So, both metrics pretty much unchanged. Moving on we have our Collateralization %. This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. We remained unchanged for the week still at 92%. Following we have the Decentralize %. Last week we saw a big reversal jumping by more than 55% but this week, we’re up small with 0.9% from last week at 22.5%. Still V v v v much bear market vibes across the board when it comes to these two metrics. We want to see the Collat % going back to the low 80s and the Decent % going back to 30s. But I’m hopeful. Okay. Quick summary Health Check. Peg Good. Curve Swap unchanged Collat % could be better. Decent % may be in a reversal. Next, we have our FrxETH segment. As always, we check the peg. Peg check here is strong you see the price delta is only 0.0003 between frxETH and ETH. Pretty much unchanged from last week. But we obvs have to go into the market and check this ourselves and you see here that I tried to do a 3500 ETH swap which is roughly the amount of the largest frxETH holder and I get an exchange rate of 0.9985. That’s not too shabby. Also, last week we had 50.5% of the frxETH staked in the Curve pool, and now we’re up small to 51.2% of the supply inside curve. The APY as per Convex is at 7.36% projected versus 7.6% for sfrxETH. The market here is so dam efficient, I love it. Let’s see what the count looks like this week. The count is at 50,705. And look at that chart, I know you can’t read it but just appreciate the verticalness off that graph. +7.5%. Hot. It may look like we’re tapering a bit but I think this new LSD narrative floating around is going to be a catalyst for more deposits. On the staked side we see that 47.8% of all the frxETH is being staked to earn the ETH native staking rewards, which is projected at the 7.94% -- very nice. We have a new slide here where we layout the LSD market landscape. Obvs, we have Lido in the lead with 29% of the market but you can see here that Frax has the highest 30-day delta in the group. Let’s keep fighting the good fight and pump up these rookie numbers! Now, let’s do a quick summary check. Peg check strong. Curve swap strong. Count up-only. Staked % healthy. Let's jump into the AMO Holdings. We have a grand total of $1010.4M across all the AMOs. This was a slight up move of 60 bps from last week but recall that we saw a massive increase form 2 weeks ago up 83.3%. Things are quiet on the AMO front. Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. Though, not everything is up small. For the month of January so far we have $470k in revenue and $1.17M in expenses. With a net loss of $700k to start our 2023. But we’re early into the month so hopefully we see some sweet sweet revenue uptick before month’s end. Quick summary money check. AMO holdings was $1010.4M, +0.6% WoW. Profitability, for December was down bad but we’re in 2023 now so eyes forward! Here's my favorite section of the Frax Check. The Liquidity Check. Do you guys remember the theme of this week, it was “Up Small”. Well, in this specific segment, we ain’t up small baby. We’re up 5% pushing us into the 80s and we’re rocking a strong 82% of the 3pool. The FraxBasedPool is $488.9M versus 3pool's $589.9M. The basedpool is up 5.5% for the week. But Note that we FLIPPED the Frax3CRV pool!!! Stepping stones, 3Pool next. Moving on, let’s chat about our metapools. Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP. We’re breaking above! We’re at $45.5M, a drop of 4.8% from last week. We just can’t seem to break above the $50M level for the past 6-7 Frax Checks. C’mon people, we got some yield and liquidity for your community, so come and get some! Any projects out there looking to work with the Metapool, please join the Flywheel pod TG chat and DM any of the hosts for assistance. Also one quick note, we also have an additional $11.7M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. The non-stable pairs TVL increased by over 10% last week. So adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $57.2M of liquidity paired against FraxBP – relatively unchanged, down small. Summary time. Liquidity Check.

58,"Watch the full episode at the end of the article Bitcoin is just money, a shiny digital rock used solely to pass perceived value back and forth between two addresses. Bitcoiners maximize trust and transactional capability above all. Network functions are limited to ensure anyone can run a full node, transforming it into a hardened digital bunker designed to survive any attack. But at the same time, Bitcoin is not meant to be innovated upon. Changes to the protocol are slow, scarce, and methodical, as to not break the singular core function.  There is no real answer as to whether this is the right method to build a blockchain. Entire digital religions have sprung up denouncing heretical evolutionaries who might enact other networks in the face of Bitcoin. I always found these arguments to be lacking, as innovation typically precludes incumbents from lasting unless their model of existence is airtight in every regard. Sreeram Kannan, founder of Eigenlayer was our guest this week. We interviewed him for almost 2 hours and he opened up to us in detail about his larger thoughts on the value systems for distributed networks. During the interview Sreeram told us: Finding Ethereum for me was a watershed moment because of the ideas mentioned above. Ethereum was the first distributed network to separate trust and innovation. First miners, now validators secure trust in the network, allowing for the ""surface area of permissionless innovation” to expand. Any anon can build on top of Ethereum services that the entire world can use and no one can be discriminated against. L2s further reduced the costs needed to bootstrap and maintain security, allowing for even more innovation to take place. It’s a paradigm shift in how we build digital products.  Eigenlayer is transformative, potentially more than any other alt-L1 or middleware protocol as it stands to completely separate trust and innovation, thus opening the door to anyone to try and construct novel applications, protocols and networks. In a couple of years we could look back on this time and wonder how the alt-L1 explosion of the early 2020’s ever could have happened with the current technology infinitely expanding the “surface area of innovation” for Ethereum. Eigenlayer is not a threat to existing systems, rather it will create a new competitive trust environment that hopefully will transform distributed networks to be vastly more efficient and secure.  Eigenlayer was founded by Sreeram Kannan, a faculty member at the University of Seattle, where he previously researched computational biology. Sreeram was always interested in distributed systems. He wrote his PhD thesis on P2P wireless systems in 2006, but the idea never really took off. Wireless infrastructure won out for its reliability and data speed. So after his PhD, he switched to computational genomics, completing his postdoc studies at Berkeley and Stanford, and then moving to Washington where he eventually became a faculty member. It wasn’t until 2018 that he started to really dive into crypto, when one of his previous advisors called him and asked him if he had heard of Bitcoin. The rest was just him falling down the crypto rabbit hole until he came up with the idea for Eigenlayer. Eigenlayer is a natural extension of Sreeram’s mental model of the world. These model define how he sees humanity, existence, and what it means to be human. One of his core mental models is based on Yuval Noah Harari’s book Sapiens, which argues that humanity’s  defining evolutionary advantage that allowed them to take over this planet is our ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers. For any other species, there is an element of wide societal trust missing, and this creates friction to cooperation. If these blockages can be reduced, groups can grow massively by means of cooperation.  Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are a new form of internet native innovations changing the world. Instead of information, they are a cooperation superhighway. Any person connected to the internet can now access these distributed value systems in a permissionless manner. Sreeram’s big application of his mental model was using the idea of the internet to make the jump to blockchain and crypto. He decided to upgrade the velocity of cooperation and hopefully accelerate the rate of innovation globally. So he dropped everything and moved over to crypto. The paradigm of innovation is that a “genius” comes up with a new idea and revolutionizes the field. But in reality, innovation is much more like evolution than intelligent design. People do science around different ideas, giving it a fitness, and then those ideas compete. The best ideas win and the process repeated. So once you have that mental model (Sreeram is all about mental models), the way you let innovation flourish is by letting many people compose pieces of innovation on top of each other. As I mentioned above, the most amazing thing about Ethereum is how it separated trust and innovation. Before blockchains, innovators faced uphill battles to build networks of trust. Attracting attention and getting funding is incredibly hard. You have to sell your vision to a select group of kingmakers (VCs) who take a cut of your business permanently in return for capital. The very nature of this process creates a required highly centralized and regulated financial system to remove trust issues. With distributed systems, however, users only have to trust the underlying network security if they believe the code is good. This is what Sreeram calls a “mind-bending” concept. Only with Ethereum-like networks is this possible. Sreeram noted this innovation was on the the same level of venture capital, which separates innovation and capital. People with ideas get together with people with capital. They both work together and create something new. This has led to huge growth over the last 70 years. Crypto radically changes the entry points into the system, rather than having to attend an Ivy League, work at a top firm, or know the right investors, any random anon can publish code that anyone in the world can consume. Sreeram said that unlike Google’s motto of “Don’t be evil,” for crypto the motto is “can’t discriminate,” as you don’t need to know who the end user is. The trust comes from the network, not the user, intermediary or government. In the first few years of Ethereum, the idea was to use sharding to expand network capabilities. But market forces eventually shuttered this idea, and the core dev team listened, giving into demands for L2 rollups. This paradigm shift was natural and market driven. It was the right choice and now L2s are the bedrock for Ethereum’s future. Eigenlayer in the next evolution of this scaling idea, moving beyond rollups to a full open trust layer that anyone can innovate on.  Everything that Eigenlayer is planning to rollout is fully dependent on the recent Proof of Stake transition, as now trust is programmable. Proof of Work is great for hardening network security, but its impossible to build in negative incentives to miners other than incorrect mining. You can’t slash in PoW, you can only fight to get block rewards. With PoS though, there is both a carrot and a stick; validators earn staking rewards, but they also can be slashed if they execute blocks incorrectly.  Functioning civilizations, in this case digital ones, need both positive and negative incentives to keep their populations in line. In the real world, we have monetary rewards for working, and also jail time and fines for perpetrating criminal acts. Before the switch the PoS, there was no way to punish someone for incorrectly publishing oracle feeds or data storage information. PoS now allows for programatic trust to be added to any validator who accepts.  Now, when you want to join Eigenlayer, you must choose which services to run. If you choose a compliance chain and you hate any and all censorship and refuse to validate certain blocks, your stake will be slashed. Same goes for any other network that is apart of Eigenlayer, they create rules on how the system should operate, and if the stakers refuse or incorrectly produce blocks, a penalty is assessed.  In our interview with ChainLinkGod, he said that Eigenlayer wasn’t a threat to existing networks with communities at large. He’s right, Eigenlayer isn’t a panacea. New ideas still have to be competent to execute on their idea and also to build communities. What it enables though is greater competition, as no incumbent protocol will have an advantage anymore solely due to its validator set and stake.  So how do you bootstrap a new protocol on Day 1 with Eigenlayer? Well the Ethereum restakers are already earning 5-6% native ETH yield. They then will be able to opt in to whichever services they want on Eigenlayer. Just like during DeFi summer, a new protocol can launch and offer a token in return for security. The token might be worthless at first, but some restakers might take the chance that it could be worth something someday.  Unlike in DeFi, the risks to the restakers are smaller, as they are committed to their ETH stake and don’t mind price fluctuations. They just want to be sure they are earning more ETH or yield. It’s a different risk category, so there should be an easier uptake to Eigenlayer than with DeFi.  Eigenlayer can support new L1s, middleware, and even smaller projects which never would have made sense to build before. There’s a weird paradox for Eigenlayer, that as more apps and protocols are secured by Ethereum restakers, the network grows more resilient. Sreeram noted that blockchains are like nation-states, and dapps are like cities. Dapps get their security from the nation-state, they don’t protect themselves. It would be strange if each city or department of the government had its own independent police force and military. You can’t run a country this way, you need an integrated security force. Once you secure your own nation, you can export your security to other nations in partnerships like NATO or the UN.  What this means for Eigenlayer is that once an oracle is launched, its data is secured by all of the Ethereum restakers supporting it. It can now provide its price feed services to any blockchain or any network. Ethereum stakers are planning to run expensive validator nodes for other networks like Solana or Aptos, but they can provide middleware services backed by the highest network security in existence. So a new L1 can bootstrap immediately all these cool services without having to build it themselves. Ethereum becomes, as Sreeram calls it, “a net exporter of security. Eventually, all of the technical arbitrage between L1s is removed and what’s left are the strongest communities and most innovative teams.  Sreeram wants to use Eigenlayer to create a new commons, where anyone can build on top of other creators in a non-permissioned way. He thinks the ideal system would basically have a “permissionless innovation license.” This would allow creators and builders to innovate on top of previous works, creating new derivatives, all while paying fees back to the original creator as attribution. In this sense, we can move past existing copyright models that inhibit growth and creativity, instead working towards a more transparent and open society where the pace of innovation is constantly accelerated.  It’s the same model as we described earlier with the cranes and skyhook. Sreeram wants more cranes, and also more incentives to build more cranes. It’s all about mental models and Eigenlayer is truly poised to drive the next wave of innovation in crypto. ",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/frxeth-breaks-50k
59,"It’s common practice in crypto to utilize stablecoins to manage price volatility. However, despite the promise of stability in the name, holding on-chain dollars in a high inflation environment still causes purchasing power to erode over time. The Frax Price Index (FPI) stablecoin is designed to be the first on-chain stablecoin with its own unit of account derived from a basket of goods, both crypto and non-crypto. FPI is pegged to a basket of real-world consumer items, as defined by the US Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The underlying goal of FPI is maintaining purchasing power- as the price of items in the CPI rises, the price of FPI grows accordingly. Like everything part of the Frax ecosystem, FPI is maintained through use of on-chain Asset Management Objects (AMOs). The stablecoin uses a specialized Chainlink oracle to pull CPI-U unadjusted 12-month inflation rate on-chain as soon as it is publicly released by the US Federal Government. This inflation rate is then applied to the redemption price of the FPI stablecoin in the system contract. The redemption price is updated on-chain every second, with the peg calculation rate being updated once every 30 days when the monthly CPI price data is released by the government. When someone buys FPI stablecoins with another asset, like ETH, they are taking the position that the purchasing power of the CPI basket is growing faster over time than the value of the ETH they are selling. Conversely, when someone sells FPI stablecoins for ETH, they are taking the position that the value of ETH is outpacing the inflation rate of the US Dollar as represented by the CPI basket of goods. The intention is for FPI to be used as a stablecoin to denominate transactions, value, and debt, and to help gauge the real-term value accrual of on-chain economics against inflation. The FPI stablecoin is also intended to help ground on-chain economics to baskets of real-world assets. The Frax Price Index Share (FPIS) token is the governance token of the FPI stablecoin, and it is entitled to seigniorage, or excess yield, from the protocol. Inflation is taken into account when determining the value of FPI, and the protocol's balance sheet must grow at least at the rate of inflation in order to maintain a 100% collateral ratio. FPIS is linked to the Frax Share (FXS) token, which is the base token of the Frax ecosystem. Both FXS and FPIS tokens accrue value proportional to the growth of the FRAX and FPI stablecoins. FPIS holders are entitled to a portion of the revenue generated by the FPI stablecoin, and FXS holders are entitled to a portion of the excess yield generated by the protocol. In addition, FPIS grants token holders governance powers such as voting over the methodology of how the CPI is calculated. This presents a pretty interesting scenario where FPI could be an independent measurement of inflation based on digital statistics (ex. Amazon.com, Cars.com, Zillow, etc.) instead of the traditional measurements that the government currently uses to measure the CPI. FRAX’s balance sheet is made up of a variety of assets such as the FRAX stablecoin and potentially other low-risk crypto-native assets like bridged BTC and ETH, as well as non-crypto consumer goods and services. The protocol then uses AMOs to generate yield, which is then directed to the FPIS or FXS token holders as excess yield. The FPI stablecoin is designed to maintain a 100% collateral ratio, which means that the protocol's balance sheet must be growing at least at the rate of inflation in order to maintain the value of the FPI stablecoin. As such, the AMO strategy contracts must earn a yield proportional to the inflation rate in order to maintain the collateral ratio. If the AMO yield is not sufficient to keep up with the inflation rate, the FPI stablecoin may use a TWAMM AMO (Time-Weighted Average Market Maker) to sell FPIS tokens for FRAX stablecoins in order to maintain the collateral ratio. At high levels of inflation, this results in the treasury having to organically fund 7+% annualized returns on FPI, which may not be sustainable. However, assuming CPI normalizes to a more manageable rate, FPI should offer investors a reliable on-chain way to protect assets from inflation risk and maintain value. In a world of complex on-chain functionality, FPI and FPIs are incredibly clear and simple tools for inflation protection. While basic use is simple: swap inflation-exposed assets for non-exposed assets, FPI’s true effect will be felt twofold. First, FPI enables growth of ‘Real World Assets’ (RWAs) within Frax’s ecosystem, tying the protocol’s on-chain monetary policy to changes in the real world. Increasing exposure to RWAs will allow Frax to reduce reliance on purely on-chain activity for sustained uptake, allowing use-cases in adverse market conditions. Other major DeFi blue chips like Maker DAO have been seeking to achieve the same, onboarding $500+mn of RWA assets from August - December 2022. What’re we left with? A .5% APR Borrow A .3% Swap Fee to Mint FPIS Up to 75% LTV in FPIS This creative strategy has positive carry through Ether staking and current inflation, and has minimized downside through low cost to borrow. Potential risks are primarily around continued ability for Frax’s protocol revenue to sustain FPI’s peg, assuming inflation remains high. Assuming 7% inflation, annualized, and 60% LTV, you could boost Ether staking yield to: = Staked Ether APR + (7% inflation * 60% LTV) - (2x Swap Fee + Net Borrow Fee) = 8% + 4.2% - 1.1% While there’s no doubt that a number of creative strategies utilizing this tech stack will be discovered in the coming months, FPI is clearly an exciting development for everyone from investors looking for inflation protection to protocol magnates looking to create optimized yield strategies.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/bing-bong-your-inflation-is-gone
60,"Cryptocurrencies have been around for over a decade now, with Bitcoin leading the charge as the first and most well-known digital asset. In the last cycle its market capitalization topped 1 trillion and many more multiples of value were settled on chain and in exchanges. Bitcoin was even accepted as legal tender by El Salvador and the Central African Republic (CAR).  Before getting into the meat of the paper, ask yourself when was the last time (or ever!) that you paid for something directly with crypto? I honestly can’t. From time to time I’ll cash out money through an exchange directly to my bank account. However, I almost never whip out my phone and make purchases with crypto.  So what is the problem? Why with all the growth and developer hours spent on growing the crypto ecosystem in the last 10 years has payments not really taken off yet? One of the main issues Kowalski points out is the high ""switching costs"" for individuals and businesses to start using cryptocurrencies for payments. Cash, credit cards, banks, and even Cashapp are just too convenient and easy to use, making it difficult for people to justify the effort of switching to a new payment system.  Bitcoin, the most popular cryptocurrency, is treated as digital gold, not as cash. Its good for making high value cross border transactions, but no one is using it to buy coffee (look its a 2017 anti-crypto argument coming up!). The Lightning Network, a proposed solution for Bitcoin's scalability issues, has yet to gain widespread adoption. Even companies like Square, who have added functionality to make LN payments have not seen major growth in the use of Bitcoin as a payment.  Bitcoin’s “brand” is independent, nebulous, trustless, and anonymous. These are not normal characteristics that average people put trust in. People like the idea of a strong leader, like SBF or CZ, who can speak clearly how the company is operating day to day. Post-FTX hubris shows that we regularly place our trust in bad actors, but this has been common since we were kicked out of the Garden of Eden for trusting the promises of a snake.  Kowalski also points out that money has social, cultural, and political dimensions that go beyond just the technology behind it. In its current state, cryptocurrencies are not yet attractive to the average person as a means of payment due to their lack of consumer protections, risk of rug pulls (sudden and unexpected changes in the value of a cryptocurrency), and high volatility. So, what can be done to increase the adoption of cryptocurrencies as a payment method? Kowalski suggests that a hybrid model, such as those adopted by companies like Square and Coinbase, may be the way forward. Alternatively, a decentralized cryptocurrency like Frax, which has the backing of a fed master account, could also potentially gain mainstream acceptance. Ultimately, it will take a combination of institutional backing and on-chain decentralization to create a legally secure, socially accepted brand that has a chance of being adopted by the average person.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/crypto-has-a-branding-problem

We actually decreased (which is a good thing) by 1.4%, which gives us a Collat % of 92%. This was the first reversal we’ve seen in a long time but fingers crossed that this is actually a reversal. Following we have the Decentralize %. Here we see another potential trend reversal but much much more bigly. We have a 55% increase since the last Frax Check and if you zoom in you could see that vertical spike up. We’re currently at 22% for the Decent %. Still V v v v much bear market vibes across the board when it comes to these two metrics. We want to see the Collat % going back to the low 80s and the Decent % going back to 30s. But gosh darn it, I am excited with these two reversal moves. Okay. Quick summary Health Check. Peg Good. Curve Swap much better this week. Collat % could be better. Decent % may be in a reversal. Next, we have our FrxETH segment. As always, we check the peg. Peg check here is strong you see the price delta is only 0.0009 between frxETH and ETH. Pretty much unchanged from last week.

And look at that chart, I know you can’t read it but just appreciate the verticalness off that graph. +12.1%. Hot. It may look like we’re tapering a bit but let’s see if we resume the uponly action next week. On the staked side we see that 49% of all the frxETH is being staked to earn the ETH native staking rewards, which is projected at the 7.94% -- very nice. Let’s do a quick summary check. Peg check strong. Curve swap strong. Count up-only. Staked % healthy. Let's jump into the AMO Holdings. We have a grand total of $1004.7M across all the AMOs. This was a MASSIVE change. We increased by 83.3%. The Curve AMO increased by $250M. And the Liquidity AMO by $10M and Investor AMO by $130M and Lending AMO by $50M. Where did all these assets just come from? For the Investor AMO, I think its from the FPI/FRAX POL, but we need to confirm that. The bump in the lending AMO is from FraxLend. The change in the Curve AMO is quite normal as the POL in that AMO is quite large. Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. Though, not everything is super rosey. For the month of December we have $1.37M in revenue and $2.01M in expenses, which gives us a net loss of $650k. We ended the year down quite a bit here but it was expected with the launch of frxETH and the cost to grow that business unit. But it’s 2023 now so let’s keep our hopes up. Upward and Onward champs. Quick summary money check. AMO holdings was $1004.7M, +83% WoW. Profitability, for December was down bad but we’re in 2023 now so eyes forward! Here's my favorite section of the Frax Check. The Liquidity Check. Do you guys remember the theme of this week, it was “New Year New Me”. Well, unfortunately here, we don’t see any changes. We’re still at 77% of the 3POOL. The FraxBasedPool is $463.6M versus 3pool's $605.9M. The basedpool down small 3.5%. But Note that we’re still NECK-to-NECK with Frax3CRV pool again. Let’s first flip this then we set our eyes on the 3pool. Moving on, let’s chat about our metapools. Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP. We’re breaking above! We’re at $47.8M, an 8% bump from last week. Any projects out there looking to work with the Metapool, please join the Flywheel pod TG chat and DM any of the hosts for assistance. Also one quick note, we also have an additional $10.2M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. The non-stable pairs TVL dropped a little down from 12.8M last week. So adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $58M of liquidity paired against FraxBP – relatively unchanged. Summary time. Liquidity Check. FraxBP is 463.6M which is 77% of 3Pool. The MetaPool is at $47.8M for stable pairs and $10.2M for non-stable pairs. And TVL of All pairs (stables + non-stables) are at $58.0M. Lastly, the main reason why we track all of this is to make sure the FRAX supply could grow as big as possible. This week we're at 1.018B, which is unchanged from last week. We’re flirting with that 9-figure digit line, and I don’t like it. We need to keep our eyes on the prize and grow this number. ",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/new-year-new-me-fraxcheck-20
62,"ldr;: FrxETH is an ETH based stablecoin with a two token design, frxETH and sfrxETH. frxETH is a stablecoin that is loosely pegged to ETH, but it receives no staking yields. FrxETH can be staked to receive sFrxETH, which receives the yield earned from staking. Token holders must choose where to get their yield…. Frax or Curve LP. Its a FLYWHEEL of epic proportions. FrxETH has the best design for a liquid ETH staking derivative (LSD) in all of crypto. If that sounds crazy to you..  In the past 2 months more than 50,000 ETH has been staked as FrxETH. That’s 60 million dollars of capital flowing into this brand new LSD. In what can only be described as otherworldly, the staking rewards for Ethereum have consistently broken double digits. And this is with nodes waiting to be accepted in the queue and MEV opportunities minimal with the total validator set. Other Liquid staking derivatives or LSD barely are earning 5-6% as their base yield. Lido’s Steth, the largest LSD by supply, is only earning 4.6%. Rocket pool’s rETH is earning a base yield of 4.48%. So what gives? How can FrxETH earn double what its competitors are making… all while doing this in the depths of a brutal bear market and with one of the most competitive assets in crypto? The answer lies in the core design of FrxETH and its two token design. But Before getting into the specifics of how smartly the Frax core dev team designed the FrxETH stablecoin… lets talk about incentives. A lot of people think that Frax is just a partially backed stablecoin. They couldn’t be further from the truth. The Frax protocol is sooooo much more than just a dollar pegged stablecoin. It’s a giant liquidity engine,, deploying billions of dollars into every single blue chip DeFi protocol. By distributing its collateral across all of DeFi, there is no longer a single point of failure or attack. DeFi as a whole is the backing for Frax. And it has used this super power to acquire large market shares of other critically important protocols like Curve and Convex.  Currently, Frax owns 6% of all Convex, staking it as Vote Locked CVX and it also has a huge chunk of veCRV in its treasury. What this means is that Frax can direct millions of dollars of incentives every month towards its own liquidity pools on Curve.finance. Each week it uses its power to direct new emissions towards its preferred pools through the Votium bribe platform. For the month of December Frax has bribed the FraxETH/ETH Curve LP with more than $1,007,554 dollars worth of CRV, CVX and FXS. In the chart below, the APR’s for the trading LP pair was well above double digits on average. Stakers are flooding into FrxETH to capture a yield that exists nowhere else in crypto. Around the new year, FrxETH should break a total supply of more than 50,000 ETH (61m USD) staked. That’s an incredible number for just 2 months of growth. Assuming the supply rate stays constant the supply of FrxETH will hit 300k ETH. With the Shanghai unlock though, FrxETH has a chance to hit escape velocity to the millions though. But we’ll come back to this later. FrxETH’s power is in its two token design. By offering two types of rewards in the FrxETH system, the Frax protocol achieves both liquidity for spot trading and also significantly higher base yields. It’s the best of both worlds through the use of bribes. The market is extremely efficient in pricing bribes. The ratio of sFrxETH to FrxETH has closely maintained yields in both the staking vault and the Curve LP over the last few weeks. The goal for Frax will be to figure out other ways for FrxETH to be used outside of the Curve LP. The more FrxETH that remains unstaked, the higher the base yield for sFRXETH will be. One idea for driving that demand would be a sFRXETH/FrxETH Fraxlend pair. Degens could use this pair to get leverage on their sFrxETH, but at the same time, lenders should not accept a rate lower than the sFrxETH staking rate. Assuming an efficient market, any difference between the two rates should be arbitraged immediately. Another option would be FrxETH’s integration into the rest of DeFi. Without bribes or subsidies I don’t see how that happens. It’s too early to tell though with the product only being 2 months old. Right now it's a one way road for conversion to FrxETH. Once ETH is staked, there is no way to withdraw it. Hence liquidity is a premium and a primary reason the Curve LP bribes are so important. In a couple of months (based on the latest announcements from the Ethereum Core Devs), the Shanghai upgrade will go live for Ethereum enabling withdrawals of staked ETH. Only a few thousand validators can unstake daily to ensure the security of the network. Ostensibly, there will be a lot of questions about what role FrxETH will have in a post Shanghai world. The Curve LP pool will shift to being a “fast exit” for FrxETH, where a premium would be paid to return back to ETH. The overall importance of the Curve LP probably will decline substantially as withdrawals reduce the need for the current liquidity imbalance. Currently there is a roughly 50/50 split between the LP and sFRXETH solely due to bribes. The assumption is that FrxETH should maintain the peg and allow for transfer back and forth between ETH at a slightly discounted rate. Right now there is zero withdrawal liquidity, the Curve LP has to absorb all sell pressure. Post-Shanghai, liquidity assumptions will further discount the exit period. Liquidity will only need to facilitate swaps between those who choose not to wait for their assets to unstake. The best analogy for the Curve LP’s role post-Shanghai is how the L2 bridges work. You can swap from Ethereum to Arbitrum immediately, but the return trip takes a week. Third party bridges like Multichain or Hop provide immediate liquidity for those that can’t wait. Pricing in the delay would be a function of the hedging risk for holding ETH for 1 week. Maybe a few dollars off the price? We will see. Another big aspect of a Post-Shanghai world is that millions of ETH locked in other liquid staking derivatives will be given market choice. Right now there is over 4 million ETH locked in the largest LSD, stETH, built and maintained by Lido. Post-Shanghai, around 1000 validators a day will be able to unstake or around 32,000 ETH daily. The ETH can then be swapped to whatever LSD is earning the highest yield, which based on Frax’s design and incentive structure, will 100% be FrxETH. No matter what Lido introduces, they won’t be able to compete with FrxETH yields. My personal predictions for 2023 have FrxETH breaking 1 million in supply by the end of the year. The Shanghai unlock is a key part of this plan. Even if the devs don’t do something and delay the unlock to 2024, FrxETH will most likely take the #2 spot above Stakewise and Rocket Pool. You just can’t compete against the Flywheel. Hats off to the Frax team for their DeFi centric two token design of FrxETH. They learned from previous mistakes that used rebasing and other sub-optimal mechanics to adjust the circulating supply. The new ERC-4626 vaults will future proof sFrxETH for all DeFi protocols that want to include it. Some of the early entrants like Balancer have already made great LP pairs that feature all the various LSD types. There are still several risk factors the core dev team needs to decentralize to fully enable FraxETH to scale massively. Notably, the validator management is currently run by the core devs. This will have to be changed in the medium term in 2024. Additionally, post-Shanghai bribe strategies might change significantly when token movement becomes more liquid. Otherwise, FrxETH is poised for a breakout year in 2023. With several high profile DeFi protocols like Gearbox planning to add FrxETH as a deposit asset, its future seems very bright.

63,"Between the highest of highs and lowest of lows, if there is one word that could encapsulate Frax in 2022, it would be “perseverance”. The year started with fresh ATHs and the vision of the DeFi Trinity that consisted of a lending market, a DEX, and a stablecoin all under one roof. During the spring, Frax’s consumer price index-pegged stablecoin FPI and the 4pool became the hottest topics of discussion which culminated in both the airdrop of FPIS as well as unfortunately the collapse of Terra LUNA. Coming out of the situation unscathed and undeterred, Frax would stay heads down and ship Fraxswap, Fraxlend, FrxETH, and Fraxferry. One of the shining milestones this year was Frax integrating with Curve at a protocol level with the passing of FRAXBP and approval to be whitelisted. Furthermore, Flywheel would launch as a podcast and bring a proper spotlight to these novel developments with exclusive interviews of core team devs & threadoors, daily protocol checks, events & meetups, and much more. By the end of the year, Frax had firmly established itself as one of the strongest DeFi protocols around as the narrative evolves from Frax being another stablecoin to the Frax building a full-fledged financial system for an on-chain world. Overall, Frax is in a prime position coming into 2023 with lots of momentum building around its yield-generating primitives such as FrxETH and Fraxlend. The core team intends to release their 2023 roadmap shortly after the new year but going forward, we can expect Frax’s collateral ratio to continuing inching back towards 100% and for progress to be made in attaining a coveted Federal Reserve Master Account. And without further ado, I present to you the Frax 2022 Year in Review!

64,"Legislation surrounding cryptocurrency has taken center stage this year as members of US Congress try to grapple with this emerging technology. While some legislators recognize crypto’s potential, others view it with criticism. Yet, a topic within cryptocurrency that has gotten a lot of attention this year is stablecoins and because of this, it's likely that they will be one of the first areas of crypto that Congress will take action on in the coming year.  People in crypto often conflate legislation as a “restrictive” outcome when in fact it provides clear direction of what is acceptable within the law. For cryptocurrency to reach the trillions in TVL, the establishment of clear and broad-based rules are a rubicon that the industry needs to cross, it’s a matter how restrictive or how empowering that legislation will be to the industry as a whole. Thanks for reading Flywheelpod! Want more alpha? Subscribe for free to receive new posts. In fact, there is one piece of legislation that may be a home run for stablecoins and set the industry forward on sensible guidelines for all. Senator Pat Toomey in one of his last actions before retirement introduced the Stablecoin TRUST Act, which provides a regulatory framework for “payment stablecoins.” Commenting on his legislation, Toomey said that: “I hope this framework lays the groundwork for my colleagues to pass legislation next year safeguarding customer funds without inhibiting innovation. I’ve put forward a regulatory model that won’t undermine competition by favoring entrenched incumbents—for example, by limiting payment stablecoin issuance to insured depository institutions. This bill will also ensure the Federal Reserve, which has displayed significant skepticism about stablecoins, won’t be in a position to stop this activity.” As some of the clearest guidelines proposed by Congress to date, the bill defines what constitutes as payment stablecoins as well as the requirements for issuers and holders. The legislation explicitly treats stablecoins as money and regulates them as such, putting them under the eye of the Office of the Comptroller of Currency (OCC) which regulates banks and depository institutions and not the SEC or CFTC. This places them safely in the camp of not being securities for issuers while also outlining public disclosure requirements for them. For holders, the act guarantees privacy protections and exempts ""new technologies like digital assets"" from the Bank Secrecy Act, declaring that ""private transactions not involving an intermediary or a financial institution do not need to be reported."" One of the most interesting parts of the bill is that it authorizes OCC to establish a new federal license specifically for payment stablecoin issuers. From this, payment stablecoin issuers will be allowed to attain Federal Reserve Master Accounts and their services. Toomey stated that his reasoning for including this is so entrenched incumbents don’t establish monopolies too early. For those unfamiliar, a Federal Reserve master account is an account that is established and maintained by a depository institution at a Federal Reserve Bank. Just as you may have a bank account at your local bank, banks themselves can have their own account at the Federal Reserve itself. A master account is used to facilitate the institution's participation in the Federal Reserve's payment and settlement services, including the clearing of checks, electronic payments, and other transactions. It is best to think of the Federal Reserve as the final ledger of settlement and all transactions between member banks are settled at the end of the day on their real-time gross settlement (RTGS) electronic payment system, Fedwire. Fedwire is operated by the Federal Reserve Banks that allows financial institutions to transfer funds and securities among themselves and with the government 24 hours a day, seven days a week and is fully audited and disclosed. Like any bank, master account depositors earn interest on their deposits which is set directly by the Chair of The Federal Reserve. Those interest rate hearings we hear about every quarter? That’s what master account depositors are earning on their deposits. To have a master account at the Fed means you are earning dollars directly from the source, the Federal Reserve itself. Now why does having a master account matter and what does it have to do with stablecoins? Well, having a master account gives you access to the safest yield in existence, the risk-free rate offered by the Fed. Stablecoins such as Tether and USDC already have treasuries on their balance sheets but having a master account is still uncharted territory. With the TRUST Act, it provides a clear pathway for fiat stablecoins to attain a Fed master account. Yet it remains that Frax is a protocol that is governed by a DAO and Sam has declared in the past that the one commandment of Frax is that it exists 100% on-chain. In order for Frax to violate its on-chain roots, it must look towards other ways to access the yield. One route it can take is to partner with a bank that already has a master account or set up a special organization whose sole purpose is to issue a payment stablecoin that is under the TRUST Act’s guidelines. This entity could issue FrxUSD which is 1-1 backed by master account deposits (and rebases a la its yield) and abides by all standard regulations. FrxUSD can then back FRAX which is integrated into DeFi, greatly reducing the protocol’s reliance on USDC. What Toomey’s legislation ultimately does is pave a pathway for stablecoins to be legitimized under law. If this legislation were to pass, I would expect there to be a stablecoin renaissance as clear guidelines will provide the framework necessary for both payment rails to be developed and for traditional institutions like banks to release their own stablecoins. Instead of GHO and crvUSD, we could very well see BofAUSD and citiUSD enter the fold. Questions still remain about crypto-native stablecoins, but since collateral can be transparently audited on-chain, it is much easier for people to scrutinize and make their own value judgments on the health of that collateral. As Frax pursues its dream of a master account, many might doubt how plausible it may be. But, if this legislation proves anything, it’s that stablecoins will continue to grow and anticipates new players (and not just traditional banks) to earn a piece of the pie.

65,"On December 19th I cheekily asked Sam Kaz when Frax planned to release FrxBTC in the wake of the news that Ren Protocol was shuttering its V1 network, leaving a gap in the market for a trustless wrapped Bitcoin asset. The question was a follow on to a discussion about FraxFerry expansion and its merits. For all purposes, the rollout of FraxFerry has been successful and well received by the Frax community. The addition of a FrxBTC bridge seemed to me a natural extension of the bridge to create a well-needed trust-minimized wrapped BTC asset on Ethereum. At its core, FraxFerry acts like a cargo boat. Slow, reliable and able to transit as much as possible. Users deposit funds into the FraxFerry contract. At a fixed time daily, the “captain” calls the contract and starts the departure process. For the next 24 hours the funds are locked and cannot be accessed. After a day, if no problems arise, the funds can be “disembarked” on the destination chain. A set of “crewmembers” can pause the ferry if they think there is a fraudulent transaction or an issue with the funds being sent. The 1 day transfer period is the core security measure in the contract. Most hacks happen in a short period of time. The Harmony hack happened over 11 transactions in the course of a few minutes. The Nomad hack drained $190m from the bridge smart contract in a few hours. Users paid for immediacy of liquidity by losing all of their funds. With FraxFerry, the 24 hour timelock is a long enough time to pause or cancel the transaction, while still being faster than other native L2 bridges with 1 week withdrawal times. It was clear after the hacks that Frax as a protocol should prioritize the safe deployment of unbacked AMO funds above everything else. The risks to the peg far outweigh any benefits of immediate liquidity. This isn’t to say that Frax immediate cross-chain liquidity on demand will not exist, but rather that users will bear the risks and not the protocol with unbacked FRAX. If an individual chooses to deposit FRAX or FXS into a bridge, it's their choice to bear the potential negative outcomes. The Frax protocol should be bound to an extremely conservative risk strategy for unbacked FRAX. AMO funds should only be deployed into the “safest,” and most battle tested contracts with long standing history and strong teams. As of writing this on Dec 21, 2022, Ren Protocol has announced the shutdown of the V1 of their network and the discontinuation of support for RenBTC. At its peak, more than 20,000 BTC was created and used on Ethereum. RenBTC was the most popular wrapped BTC asset after WBTC, and it was the only trust minimized product with significant market share and liquidity. RenBTC currently has over $4.5m deposited into Curve. In the Frax main chat, Sam K dropped some hints as to how FrxBTC would be setup. “Ya we'd need to run a BTC full node and also code a special purpose ferry that is basically a BTC SPV client for trustless verification of BTC movements on the BTC PoW chain. It isn't trivial, but it isn't insanely hard. It's more a question of scope and whether there would be significant need or usage of frxBTC.” To create FrxBTC, Frax DAO would have to setup a multisig contract that controls the operations of a Bitcoin full node. According to Sam, the bridge would be “trust minimized” since Bitcoin does not support smart contracts. Instead, a collection of multi-sig controlled by veFXS holders would manage the Bitcoin node. Westwood then popped in to ask some great questions about the decentralization of FrxBTC. The primary problem with the creation of FrxBTC is that Bitcoin is a useless rock that produces zero revenues. The only fees that Frax will receive from creation and operation of FrxBTC would be from minting/unminting and the Fraxlend AMO. Assuming that FrxBTC could reach the same size as RenBTC at its peak and charges a 0.25% fee, Frax would earn 50 BTC ($840,000) from minting alone. Fraxlend fees are harder to gauge due to how much demand their might be for the product. If FrxBTC is not as successful as Ren, the fees might never exceed the costs and maintenance of the FraxFerry bridge. Costs aside, there is a deeper question about which assets Frax should support in Fraxlend. To preserve security, Frax is only supporting high quality assets with AMO funds. The majority of asset markets are either Frax based products (FPI, FrxETH, FXS) and other Ethereum based assets (OHM, CRV, CVX) that are connected to the Frax ecosystem in some way. Notably, other competitor assets like StETH, rETH, and other LSDs are missing from Fraxlend. Creation of the FrxBTC asset and its addition to Fraxlend would mean that Frax would have full control over its use, liquidations, and safety within the Frax ecosystem of products. No longer would Frax have to worry about the long term viability, security and independence of WBTC. We could establish the last major piece in the Frax ecosystem with a DAO controlled Bitcoin asset. For all the platitudes though, creation of FrxBTC is at its core a question of time and resources. The DAO should really ask whether there will be significant demand for FrxBTC and will it improve the Frax protocol on the whole? There is not much benefit for Frax outside of providing a spot market in Curve and a lending market in Fraxlend. Organic demand is the only way a product like this can survive. “BTC does not have any kind of yield or inherent value other than as a non-custodial digital asset (which is valuable in and of itself but that's it). So other than it being a cost that weighs down the protocol to subsidize its yield, there's really no reason for it to exist. At least that's my current view.” If the DAO chooses to create FrxBTC its unclear if it would ever be a profitable part of the ecosystem or if anyone would actually mint it. Sam K continues “ it needs to fit into the Frax vision. We don't ship random protocol features for fun. Like for example, we're not going to do something as random as an NFT marketplace. We have no reason or scope to be in that arena. But the question is, does a BTC stablecoin make sense. I'm not really sure.”- Sam K So at the end of the day, Frax can create FrxBTC, it can be used in Fraxlend and LP in Curve/Fraxswap. Is this enough to warrant its creation? We will find out in a few days once the Snapshot vote is over. If it passes the RFQ will open the question to proposals and we will see what the best choices for the DAO are. Continue the conversation on the governance forum: RFQ: Create FrxBTC using FraxFerry Very nice article,  I am just starting to explore Frax protocol.  I have one comment regarding your comment in BTC being non productive asset and I would say that even USD backed stables (USDC,USDT) are not productive in that sence either and might be even worse due to money printing and inflation although I recognize that it has very high demand from people.  I think there could also the use of frxBTC as truessary diversification for DAOs e.g Olympous( at least that my hope) especially since it is less correlated to ETH price.  also the market cap of WBTC is very big (23rd as of currently) so I would guess there’s that demand.   This is all a defend in favor to BTC since I like it much and might be biased. In the end market will decided.  Very nice article,  I am just starting to explore Frax protocol.

66,"Welcome to Frax Check. Your weekly frax vibe check. I am your host Kapital_K and I’m joined by my cohost DeFi Dave and our producer extraordinaire Sam. We will be going straight to the source of truth via checking the chain. Before we jump in, please subscribe to the flywheelpod and follow us @flywheelpod on Twitter and telegram. This week.. I call this week the “Lil bit of dis and lil bit of dat” week. We have some ups and some downs and some unchanged. Let's begin our regular programming with the Peg. We saw it get as low as $0.998 with a high of $1.001 for the week. Peg Check = Strong. We then looked at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We received a 0.9983 exchange rate, which is an increase of 2 bps compared to last week’s. So both metrics pretty much unchanged. Moving on we have our Collateralization %. This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. We are unchanged over the week at 93.3%. We’ve been at these levels for the last 5 Frax Checks. Following we have the Decentralize %. We bounced off the lows and have been hovering around the 14 to 15% mark. This week we’re back down to 14% so that’s down move of 1.8%. But still V v v v much bear market vibes across the board when it comes to these two metrics. We want to see the Collat % going back to the low 80s and the Decent % going back to 30s. Okay. Quick summary Health Check. Peg Good. Curve Swap much better this week. Collat % could be better. Decent % bounce from ATL and now ranging. Next, we have our new segment of the check where we look at FrxETH. As always, we check the peg. Peg check here is strong you see the price delta is only 0.0014 between frxETH and ETH. Pretty much unchanged from last week. But we obvs have to go into the market and check this ourselves and you see here that I tried to do a 3500 ETH swap which is roughly the amount of the largest frxETH holder and I get an exchange rate of 0.9965. That’s not too bad. Also, last week we had 61% of the frxETH staked in the Curve pool, and now we’re up a little to 63.5% of the supply inside curve. The APY as per Convex is at 9% projected versus 10.8% for sfrxETH. Littttt. Let’s see what the count looks like this week. The count is at 44,800. And look at that chart, I know you can’t read it but just appreciate the verticalness off that graph. +6.5%. Hot. It may look like we’re tapering a bit but let’s see if we resume the uponly action next week. On the staked side we see that 36% of all the frxETH is being staked to earn the ETH native staking rewards, which is projected at the 10.8% -- very nice. Let’s do a quick summary check. Peg check strong. Curve swap strong. Count up-only. Staked % healthy. Let's jump into the AMO Holdings. We have a grand total of $547.4M across all the AMOs. This was unchanged compared to last week. The Curve AMO increased by $3M. And the Liquidity and Investor AMO decreased by like $5M. So just some musical chairs going on with the assets here. No news this week on the AMOs. Again we are ranging here too. No much movement in the past few Frax Checks. Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. We’re now at $960k in Revenue for the month of December so far. We paid roughly $750k in bribes plus the monthly opex of $430k for expenses. Therefore, for December we have a loss of $220k currently. But it’s still very early so let’s keep our hopes up. Upward and Onward champs. Quick summary money check. AMO holdings was $547M, -0.1% WoW. Profitability, for November was down bad but we’re early into December so fingers crossed. Here's my favorite section of the Frax Check. The Liquidity Check. Do you guys remember the theme of this week, it was “Lil bit of this and lil bit of that”. Well, we’re unchanged. We’re at 78% of the 3POOL. The FraxBasedPool is $476M versus 3pool's $613M. The basedpool pretty much unchanged since last week. But Note that we’re NECK-to-NECK with Frax3CRV pool again. Let’s first flip this then we set our eyes on the 3pool. Moving on, let’s chat about our metapools. Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP. We’re breaking above! We’re at $49.6M. We did get as low as $38M 3 weeks ago so I’m glad to see this relief bounce. Any projects out there looking to work with the Metapool, please join the Flywheel pod TG chat and DM any of the hosts for assistance. Also one quick note, we also have an additional $11.4M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. The non-stable pairs TVL dropped a little down from 12M last week. So adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $61M of liquidity paired against FraxBP, flat for the week.  Summary time. Liquidity Check. FraxBP is 476.8M which is 78% of 3Pool. The MetaPool is at $49.6M for stable pairs. And TVL of All pairs (stables + non-stables) are at $61.0M. Lastly, the main reason why we track all of this is to make sure the FRAX supply could grow as big as possible. This week we're at 1.023B, which is unchanged from last week. We’re flirting with that 9-figure digit line and I don’t like it. We need to keep our eyes on the prize and grow this number. ",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/little-bit-of-this-little-bit-of
67,"Money is made of 4 things, it should hold its value day to day, people should use it to buy and sell things, its value is a global reference for goods, and it should be redeemable at par on demand for exact or similar value. Once something satisfies all four things, it potentially could be accepted as money. But this is extremely hard, as the incumbent’s power is deeply ingrained globally and socially. Crypto money is not trying to work outside of these generally accepted money principles (GAMP). The largest players are actually working hard to proliferate within its principles. USDC/BUSD/Tether all stake their worth against the dollar (and people love it!). Frax/DAI and other decentralized stablecoins are also using different models to peg to the dollar. Money outside of GAMP typically fails to ever be used as money. If you can’t walk into a store, see prices in your money and then transact with it without significant fees or slippage, your money is probably not going to survive. Everyone references the dollar; even foreigners outside the US have some second level understanding of the dollar price against their own currency. GAMP rules everything around me. So given GAMP, where do synthetics fit in? Ok, so you’ve got your G-coin that synthetically tracks a climate change index. Every day you look at it sadly knowing that humanity will never hit its climate targets and the global temperature is set to rise 1.5 degrees over the next century. Governments make cute statements about meeting targets, but you know deep down that China and the USA will never tame their emissions, committing the world to untold death, destruction and the end of humanity. Tears roll down your face when you enter Starbucks, Solanaphone in hand and step up to order a decaf iced gingerbread Almond milk latte with extra whipped cream. You flick open your crypto wallet while remembering the coffee giant uses more than 8,000 paper cups a minute, most of which are not recyclable. Your synthetic climate change coin is up .1% in the last year to match the current rise in average temperatures. As you go to pay, liquidity in Uniswap is $250,000, most of which is yours. If you want to sell the slippage will be 4%, one degree higher than the worst case for global temperatures globally in 2100. Whatever, you need your sugary drink. Send transaction. Unfortunately the dollar is a shared way of knowing the world in value. GAMP principles pre-internet led to the creation of many currencies globally, now monopolized by the state. In a post-internet world, we’re working towards the end of money, which will be a single reference currency for all value transacted globally. GAMP demands this efficient harmonization, there can be no second best. The reason we in the crypto community want an independent dollar has nothing to do with trying to improve its GAMP. They are set in stone after thousands of years of social determination. Crypto money is and will continue to be a declaration of independence against the tyranny of the regional money issuer and their weaponization of money and finance. A rejection of established norms that downstream garbage loan rates, inflation (the bad kind), and predatory fees to the weakest of retail consumers. To top it all off, modern governments are doing their best to create a hyper aware financial intelligence apparatus to ensure hegemonic continuation of the competing, established monetary order. Terra’s Luna was hailed pre-collapse as an exquisite, independent, refined replacement for the dollar. Hindsight wiped these platitudes indefinitely, but they embodied a general desire, which Goertzel is tapping in his article, to create a functioning non-state dollar free of any assets held on a balance sheet in a bank. The only question we should be asking in crypto is how do we build, distribute, and command power in a fully decentralized, non-political, dollar with unseizable collateral aka the Stablecoin Trilemma. Frax has achieved initial fitting with GAMP plus remaining unseizable to a point. Frax relies on its AMO’s to distribute the freezing risk to its collateral across the entirety of DeFi. Long term a better solution will have to be found with Frax explicitly given the green light to custody its own collateral in a bank or for some jurisdiction to provide a strong regulatory and legal environment for Frax to exist. GAMP US dollar stablecoins have different problems than trying to find market fit. Synthetic money with no easily identifiable pricing immediately turns into a dollar referenced investment product. Add on to that a lack of GAMP and you end up with a random digital asset that no one will use. Unless there is a defined reason for the synthetic to exist, like with Frax’s FPI, an inflation resistant (investment product) which tracks the CPI index. FPI can exist and grow for two reasons. First, inflation as a topic is highly covered in the media and discussed by the general population. Retail doesn’t know what the CPI numbers are off-hand, but they can give a rough idea if inflation is high or low. When FPI changes in price, the mental models process the asset value in reference to the widely publicized month on month reports. In fact, FPI holders probably don’t even reference the price that much, they just see inflation going up or down and assume their FPI holding value is doing the same. Second, FPI isn’t trying to be GAMP (atm, at least). Unlike Bitcoin which attaches fixed supply monetarism to its core principles, FPI simply tries to track the official adjusted values for inflation over time. For nebulous things other than inflation, it becomes near impossible to create frames of reference for an index. Real (gold, diamonds, etc) and financial assets (equities, bonds, derivatives) are easily tracked because they have a market traded price. For indexes like “climate change,” the reference price is probably heavily politicized and issued by an elite international governing body like the World Bank, IMF, and or UN. These institutions are inherently more corrupt, politicized, and agenda driven than a nationalized banking system, as the latter always works in its own self interest and is not based on a global committee. A climate change-indexed stablecoin would be extremely unideal simply because it attaches itself to politics while trying to be apolitical. It’s a terrible oracle problem, where the exactness of the data isn’t at question, but the very assumptions used to generate it. Crypto is and needs to be focused on apolitical solutions, not pegging to the evil empires responsible for Bitcoin’s genesis. We shouldn’t fear the dollar or any other fiat. It’s just a reference system. Our largest concerns should lie in the loss of self-sovereignty and accessibility to dollars",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/no-we-dont-need-weirdly-pegged-stable
68,"One of the biggest “myths” that’s been foisted on retail traders is the idea of “impermenant loss.” This is a poorly understood concept that gets boiled down to traders complaining about receiving less quantity of tokens after providing them to a Constant Function Market Maker (CFMM) like Uniswap or Curve. The problem here though is that “option traders” don’t think in terms of unit cost. They only think in cash balance terms. In the above example, the trader started with a cash balance of $50,000 (25 ETH + $25,000). When they withdrew their cash balance was $70,000. Had they held they would have had substantially more, but ultimately the trade they took was a winning one. They profited at the end of the day and their cash balance ended up higher than what they started with. If prices moved downwards, then the trader would end up with MORE ETH and less dollars. Thus, the goal for retail LPs at the end of the day should be simple; end with more money than you started with. There’s a widespread mental problem that affects many traders. They think up and down, but eschew time completely. Every trade turns into “THIS IS GOING TO DO 1000% TOMORROW GET READY [ROCKET SHIP EMOJI x10].” And sure, that might be the case in 1 in every million trades, but in reality price goes up or down slightly, then none, then a lot, then crashes, recovers, etc. Straight up and down is rare. For the sake of simplicity, there are roughly 5 different outcomes that can happen with price in a given period: Up Only Slightly up Flat/Crab Slightly down Down only Every trade is a choice of what expected outcomes are going to be. If you think 1 or 5, you want to be max bid or short and happily not collect any fees. If 2, then LP or holding might be a good option, the call to make will be “will my cash balance be higher from LP fees over X period of time?” if not then hold. 3 is always best for LP since you earn fees over the time period. 4 is only good for LPs when the fees outweigh the price decline. This rudimentary model for how to allocate assets assumes the goal at the end of the period is to maximize cash balances. Ok, now that we’ve covered the IL myth for retail traders let’s get into Gamma Swap. Since LPs are options sellers, they are “short gamma,” which means they “lose” money the further prices get away from their starting point. The chart below created by the Gamma Swap team shows how as prices move in either direction, LPs gain more of one asset and lose the other. Gamma Swap creates a market for traders to bet on either LP + fees or holding assets outright. Traders deposit their CFMM LP tokens into the Gamma Swap contract. LPs are always short gamma. They will continue to earn fees while their LP is deposited to Gamma Swap. Once deposited, borrowers can come and go “long gamma” by posting collateral and borrowing the reserve assets used in the CFMM LP. Borrowers are betting on either option 1 or 5 above as the outcome. If volatility is high and prices move a lot in one direction, borrowers profit as the “impermanent loss” becomes an “impermanent gain” for them. Assume ETH is $1000 If ETH moves to $2000 Difference between LP and GS Borrower = $150,000 - 141,421.36 - Fees?? = 8,578.64 So in this case the GS Borrower would potentially profit $8.5k USD minus whatever fees are collected by the LP over the period. If the fees are less than the impermanent gain difference, then they profit. This example can be reversed for prices going down. It works either way. Gamma Swap keeps track of the assets that are borrowed and the yield accrued to the LPs during that time. Interest accrues and must be paid back when the position is closed. If the interest exceeds the borrowers collateral, its liquidated and used to repurchase assets for the LPs. Liquidations happen without any oracles. One of the common attacks on lending protocols is flash loans. In a single block the price of an asset is moved up or down a significant amount, allowing the attacker to manipulate lending protocols with the goal of extracting unearned value and leaving bad debt. Because of the risk curve on Gamma Swap, it makes no difference whether the price goes up or down significantly, as the only outcome that matters is the number of LP tokens delivered back to the protocol. The Gamma Swap team thinks their model can be applied to all token pairs safely and securely, creating new markets for long gamma traders. What’s so cool about Gamma Swap is that they enable long gamma positions without LPs having to do anything except deposit into their smart contract. LPs always explicitly will be short gamma, Gamma Swap is simply enabling a new type of trade to be derived from the underlying asset. It’s a very smart implementation and will unlock new ways for sophisticated traders to profit in different market conditions. Ultimately, retail LPs can keep their same simple strategies and deposit their funds into GS. Pro traders can then use their reserve assets to trade volatility and the LPs earn extra interest on top of the fees they already collect. It’s a very simple, but effective asset usage strategy. We’ll be watching intently to see how it performs and if there is actual demand for long gamma once it launches. What’s super cool about Gamma Swaps model is that if Frax/USDC LP is added as collateral, the long gamma position taken by the trader now becomes peg insurance. With stable/stable LPs the volatility should very, very, low all the time. If the peg were to break and price moved significantly away from $1, it would represent a huge move in gamma. Thus a Frax LP who wants peg insurance can go long the Frax/USDC LP in Gamma Swap for the time they think the peg is under stress. Leverage through Fraxlend - To qualify this, I don’t know how the Frax team would integrate the GS token into an oracle or TWAP function to get a good price feed. I don’t know if the GS tokens are composable. But even so, leverage on long gamma positions will be really desirable. For the bluechip crypto pairs traders will probably earn 2-5% on their trades. With leverage using Frax as the loan instrument, those returns could be juiced 10-20x higher.  In theory locked LP could be added to GS and pose no risk to the protocol so long as the borrower collateral is golden. LPs would earn increased fees and the protocol isn’t at risk (Other than smart contract risk). While this might introduce too much risk for the core team to implement, maybe the GS team, or another team like Pitch would integrate locked LP and GS somehow. Again, all theory.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/gamma-swap-a-new-type-of-money-lego
69,"This was the most shocking thing I’ve read this year in crypto. USDT is the most popular crypto in Iran and it’s primarily used on the Tron blockchain…. Huh?? What in His Excellency Justin Sun? Shocking (but not really… more on that later). A dollar based product is more popular than Bitcoin in a country where the IRGC is the largest miner of BTC. Bitcoin maximalists in disbelief that normie under sanctions eschew the most decentralized currency in favor of Tether on a quasi-centralized ETH clone. Very strange indeed. When digging deeper though, it makes a lot of sense. Tether is a private offshore dollar that is free of the influence of the United States and its many, many three letter agencies. It’s valuable without being political. After reading Ameen’s tweet, I tried to put together a “fiatcoin (dollar) trilemma;” include is globally accepted, free of political influence, anonymous digital cash. Tether is borderline qualifying for all three characteristics at the moment. It’s no wonder that regulators and politicians are doing their damndest to shut Tether down. “Dollars'' are a nebulous term representing many different forms of money. I like to think of the “Dollar” as whatever current debt-based global reserve and transaction currency is at the current moment. It doesn’t really matter whether we call it the Pound, or Yuan, or Euro. The “Dollar” is a system of money, and more importantly the financial system built on top which makes the global economy function. The US dollar was selected as the best choice for this purpose because of the independence, safety, security of our Banks and additionally the strong legal protections for all parties found in US courts. Throw in post-WW2 strength and its no wonder the dollar achieved its current position. There just is no second best. Even in crypto networks the only currency that anyone wants to really hold are dollars. Stablecoin supply growth has gone from 1bn in 2020 to a peak of 200bn before the LUNA crash. Stablecoins are the “killer app” of crypto. Dollar access and control are the reason that crypto exists in the first place. Hard money advocates and libertarians had tried for decades to create functional private dollar replacements that could eschew politics. Money is inherently political and pre-Bitcoin, the United States used its powerful banhammer to annihilate any upstart private currencies. Tether’s genius strategy revolves around “how” it distributes its tokens. Unlike Liberty Reserve, which acted as a quasi-bank with its own currency, Tether provides no accounts for its customers or holders. Unless you are an exchange, large OTC desk or institutional client, redeeming and minting USDT directly is out of the question. USDT is available to purchase from a network of brokers who make fees from swaps. It’s the brokers job to perform KYC and ensure the sales do not violate any international laws. Binance, as the largest crypto exchange in the world, is the top broker of USDT. Binance also is embroiled in a lawsuit that it allowed $7.8bn flow to Iranian trading firms and users. “Three-quarters of the Iranian funds that passed through Binance were in a relatively low-profile cryptocurrency called Tron'' Reuters reported. Private ZK tech on its own was not enough to drive Tron adoption in Iran, Monero, Zcash, and other privacy coins all failed to have significant impact on the market. It was only when a stable dollar substitute was introduced that adoption kicked off. Now Tether is a core part of the Iranian economy. ZK is poised to eventually come to ETH at some point in the future. Privacy is dearly needed at the L2 level for ETH based assets. The model has been proven for Tron based assets. Maybe this is where Frax’s L2 can shine? Private, stable transfers with instant finality for free? Crypto is and will always be a response to dollar shortages, access, and control. Eventually market forces will demand a non-political stable unit of account that is widely used globally. Post-9/11 the United States weaponized the dollar to punish and cajole its allies and enemies abroad. In a perfect world, the US as the global hegemony would be a fair harbinger of power, but reality has proved otherwise. As stablecoin regulation in the US and Europe harps on the horizon, the question remains how legislators will act in the face of technology that threatens their monopoly over the flow of money.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/his-excellency-and-tether-combine
70,"If you wanted to kill the crypto industry, but not change any of its technology…. How would you do it? Turning off the internet isn’t really a viable option. And banning code from Github is a free speech violation. In reality, the solution is much more simple…. Introduce bureaucracy. A lot of it. Thanks for reading Flywheelpod! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support our work. Make it prohibitively impossible for a company to functionally use crypto, and they won’t even touch it. Sure, it may only cost a few cents to move 100 million USD, but if you tack on several million in administration costs the transfer fees won’t even matter. The way that this would be executed would be forcing all participants in the crypto ecosystem to enforce KYC checks on every transaction and wallet. Want to move some Bitcoin? Well the miners need to know you are KYC’d and aren’t on the OFAC sanctions list before they can include your transaction in the block. Your unhosted wallet provider would also have to start implementing KYC before you are even allowed to enter your private keys. Smart contract operators would be legally bound to deny anyone who was anonymous from calling their contracts. Developers would be liable for publishing open-source, anonymous, unregulated code to Github if it didn’t enforce the Bank Secrecy Act rules. A fully permissioned walled garden with total surveillance. Today Senators Warren and Marshall introduced the Digital Asset Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2022. The bill will not be passed this year and has a very low chance of even making past committees next year. But it shows where some contingent of Congress is throwing in their hats. Our industry is hitting sufficient size and the power players are out for blood. The DAAML bill changes the definition of pretty much all crypto market participants to be Money Service Businesses. What this means is that they would have to collect KYC information on all parties that transact through their network or face fines. Under these rules, Bitcoin miners and Ethereum validators would be forced to collect, retain, and filter identifying info on all wallets sending digital assets back and forth on their networks. Furthermore, unhosted wallet and smart contract developers would be liable for publishing open source code if they didn’t include means to check the identity of the parties using the software. Forcing Bitcoin miners and PoS validators to KYC network participants has been a fringe demand for years now. This is the first time though that it has been proposed as a bill in the US congress. Maybe it's just a result of the current post-FTX milieu, but it's a direct shot across the bow of our industry and the millions of market participants globally who depend on these decentralized networks. Additionally, this represents yet another attack on open source developers who have a clear and enshrined right to publish code without punishment. Nor can the government compel an individual to speech based on existing laws. Developers cannot be arrested for publishing open source code that is found to be in violation of the Bank Secrecy Act. Sen. It's an unconstitutional assault on the 1st amendment. None of what is written in the bill would have prevented the fraud perpetrated by SBF at FTX. These two opportunistic Senators are latching onto the negative coverage in the media right now to try and railroad through a potentially unconstitutional bill. It shows their true colors, establishment of a financialized security state much akin to China or Russia, where the government agencies have unfettered access to the financial lives of all Americans and people around the globe. An omnipresent overseer of all economic and financial activity, using data to build a hyper-aware surveillance system that weaponizes money and banking against those it considers the enemy or undesirable. The general claim for this obtuse bureaucracy will always be “nAtIoNaL sEcUrItY” or preventing “terrorism” or god knows what other silly bullshit was made up in the wake of 9/11. 25 years ago we didn’t have an all seeing overload wanting to look at every transaction over $600 globally. Any looney presenting a bill in 2000 that would have degrade financial privacy rights the way the BSA did would have been tarred, feathered, and chased out of Washington right quick. Having worked adjacently with the NSA many decades ago, the end goal of the surveillance state is a 24/7 full overview of every citizen's actions, speech, and financial accounts. The NSA called it “Total Information Awareness.” A state of knowing the target in question better than they know themselves. With the growth of AI, and other tool assisted filtering programs, it has never been easier for a massive security agency to maintain hegemonic control over its citizens. China, Russia, North Korea all dream of this outcome. It’s the primary way that you control a population and suppress dissent. Anonymity is not a bad or criminal thing. On public networks it’s a gift. Separating your public and private life is necessary to live without fear of wrench attacks or agents from three-letter government agencies showing up at your door in the middle of the night. While this might seem somewhat unhinged and conspiratorial for people living in Europe and the West, it's a regular occurrence in despotic countries. We don’t have to guess how much power is wielded with these abilities. And this is why Sen. Warren’s and Marshall’s bill is such a travesty of the law. It would compel open source developers to write specific code to satisfy KYC regs, otherwise they would face jail time. Code is free speech. The state cannot stop or punish someone for publishing code. The OFAC sanctions this year showed how poorly thought out the action was and scores of innocent privacy-loving individuals who had committed no crimes were caught up in its scope. We can’t have a repeat on a much grander scale. This bill needs to be shut down through any means possible. It’s just bad all around and seeks to ensconce a banking monopoly for existing institutional actors. 2023 is going to be a landmark year for crypto legislation, no matter what digital asset you support. We can’t let the actions of a few deceitful, power hungry liars to distort the public's view of our industry. We can’t lose control of the narrative of an open, more equal and transparent financial system. It’s why we have to fight and speak loudly for those who are making a positive difference. Flywheel came together in the wake of the Luna collapse to try and reclaim that narrative. We believe that we’re on the precipice of a new monetary regime and have one chance to enact sensible legislation that helps our industry grow and thrive. Bills like this are anathema to our goals and vision, highlighting their dangers is necessary. Ryon told us after the bill was published that “Senator Warren’s failure to take the time to understand the nuances of the cryptocurrency market are apparent in the drafting of this bill.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/senator-elizabeth-warren-is-trying
71,"Welcome to Frax Check. Your weekly frax vibe check. I am your host DeFi Dave, filling in for Kapital_K. As always, I'm joined by producer extraordinaire Sam. We will be going straight to the source of truth via checking the chain. Before we jump in, please subscribe to the flywheelpod and follow us @flywheelpod on twitter and tg. This week.. I call this week the “Just Keep Swimming” week. But cross your fingers and cross your chains I didn’t just jinx us. Let's begin our regular programming with the Peg. We saw it get as low as $0.997 with a high of $1.000 for the week. Peg Check = Strong. We then looked at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We received a 0.9981 exchange rate, which is an increase of 9 bps compared to last week’s. Moving on we have our Collateralization %. This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. We are unchanged over the week at 93.3%. We’ve been at these levels for the last 4 Frax Checks. Following we have the Decentralize %. We bounced off the lows and have been hovering around the 14 to 15% mark. This week we’re at 14.7%. But still V v v v much bear market vibes across the board when it comes to these two metrics. We want to see the Collat % going back to the low 80s and the Decent % going back to 30s. Okay. Quick summary Health Check. Peg Good. Curve Swap much better this week. Collat % could be better. Decent % bounce from ATL and now ranging. Next, we have our new segment of the check where we look at FrxETH. As always, we check the peg. Peg check here is strong you see the price delta is only 0.0007 between frxETH and ETH. We obvs have to go into the market and check this ourselves and you see here that I tried to do a 3500 ETH swap which is roughly the amount of the largest frxETH holder and I get an exchange rate of 0.9981. That’s not too bad. Also, last week we had 61% of the frxETH staked in the Curve pool, and now we STILL have 61% of the supply inside curve. The APY as per Convex is at 11% projected. Littttt. That’s why everyone is here. Let’s see what the count looks like this week. The count is at 42,058. And look at that chart, I know you can’t read it but just appreciate the verticalness off that graph. “Straight Tubular bro’.” +32%. Hot. On the staked side we see that 39% of all the frxETH is being staked to earn the ETH native staking rewards, which is 5-7% but since only about 40% frxETH is staked, sfrxETH stakers get a boost in their staking rewards. But also important to note that folks who are so deep into DeFi are so dam efficient. Literally less than 0.5% of the frxETH supply is just sitting naked, every other frxETH is put to work. Like the CapitalOne commercials: “What’s in your wallet?” Better not be WETH! Let’s do a quick summary check. Peg check strong. Curve swap strong. Count up-only. Staked % healthy. Let's jump into the AMO Holdings. We have a grand total of $548.0M across all the AMOs. This was unchanged compared to last week. The Curve AMO increased by $1M. So no news this week on the AMOs. Again we are ranging here too. No much movement in the past few Frax Checks. Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. We’re now at $620k in Revenue for the month of December so far. We paid roughly $750k in bribes plus the monthly opex of $430k for expenses. Therefore, for December we have a loss of $560k currently. But it’s still very early so let’s keep our hopes up. Upward and Onward champs. Quick summary money check. AMO holdings was $549M, +0% WoW. Profitability, for November was down bad but we’re early into December so fingers crossed. Here's my favorite section of the Frax Check. The Liquidity Check. Do you guys remember the theme of this week, it was “Just Keep Swimming”. And you know how we’ve just literally been ranging these past few weeks. (Dave gets excited) SOMETIMES WHEN YOU KEEP SWIMMING AND KEEP PERSERVERING, YOU WIN. We’re at 78% of the 3POOL. Let’s GO. WE AIN’T RANGING IN NO MO’. WE TRENDING UP BABY. The FraxBasedPool is $480.5M versus 3pool's $615M. The basedpool saw an increase of nearly 7% in TVL, that’s like $30M baby. But Note that we’re NECK-to-NECK with Frax3CRV pool again. Let’s first flip this then we set our eyes on the 3pool. Moving on, let’s chat about our metapools. Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP. We’re ranging again now at $44.2M versus $44.4M last week. Pretty much unchanged. We did get as low as $38M 2 weeks ago so I’m glad to see this relief bounce. Any projects out there looking to work with the Metapool, please join the Flywheel pod TG chat and DM any of the hosts for assistance. Also one quick note, we also have an additional $12.8M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. Surprisingly, the non-stable pairs TVL was pretty much unchanged for the week (again for the third week in a row). So adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $57.2M of liquidity paired against FraxBP, flat for the week. This ranging stuff is cute but please continue uponly next week! Summary time. Liquidity Check. FraxBP is 480.5M which is 78% of 3Pool. The MetaPool is at $44.2M for stable pairs. And TVL of All pairs (stables + non-stables) are at $57.0M.

72,"Welcome to Frax Check. Your weekly frax vibe check. I am your host Kapital K. As always, I'm joined by my co host DeFi Dave and producer extraordinaire Sam. We will be going straight to the source of truth via checking the chain. Before we jump in, please subscribe to the flywheelpod and follow us @flywheelpod on twitter and tg. This week.. I call this week the “Holiday Bounce” week. Shimmering of hope. Let's begin our regular programming with the Peg. We saw it get as low as $0.998 with a high of $1.000 for the week. Peg Check = Strong. We then looked at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We received a 0.9972 exchange rate, which is an increase of 26 bps compared to last week’s. The Frax team has yet to balance the pool so there’s an imbalance of like 75/25 Frax/USDC in the pool right now. Moving on we have our Collateralization %. This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. We are unchanged over the week at 93.3%. Following we have the Decent %. We bounced off of the lows and have remained unchanged the 14.7%. We’re definitely in the low range but I hope I didn’t jinx us by just saying that. V v v v much bear market vibes across the board when it comes to these two metrics. We want to see the Collat % going back to the low 80s and the Decent % going back to 30s. Okay. Quick summary Health Check. Peg Good. Curve Swap much better this week. Collat % could be better. Decent % bounce from ATL. Next, we have our new segment of the check where we look at FrxETH. As always, we check the peg. Peg check here is strong you see the price delta is only 0.0013 between frxETH and ETH. We obvs have to go into the market and check this ourselves and you see here that I tried to do a 3500 ETH swap which is roughly the amount of the largest frxETH holder and I get an exchange rate of 0.9970. That’s not too bad. Also, last week we had 66% of the frxETH staked in the Curve pool, and now we have 61% of the supply inside curve. The APY as per Convex is at 10% projected. Littttt. That’s why everyone is here. Let’s see what the count looks like this week. The count is at 31,677. And look at that chart, I know you can’t read it but just appreciate the verticalness off that graph. +32%. Hot. On the staked side we see that 39% of all the frxETH is being staked to earn the ETH native staking rewards, which is 5-7% but since only about 40% frxETH is staked, sfrxETH stakers get a boost in their staking rewards. Let’s do a quick summary check. Peg check strong. Curve swap strong. Count up only. Staked % healthy. Let's jump into the AMO Holdings. We have a grand total of $549.4M across all the AMOs. This was unchanged compared to last week. The Curve AMO increased by $1M. So no news this week on the AMOs. Onto the profitability of the Convex AMO. We’re now at $2.17M in Revenue for the month of November. We paid roughly $2.2M in bribes so far plus about $430k in expense. Therefore, for November we have a loss of $460k. No Profit November is confirmed. Let’s hope December fairs better. So far, we have a revenue of $280k with monthly expenses of $430k so the net profit so far is a loss of $150k. But it’s still very early so let’s keep our hopes up. Quick summary money check. AMO holdings was $549M, +0% WoW. Profitability, for November was downbad but we’re early into December so fingers crossed. Here's my favorite section of the Frax Check. The Liquidity Check. Do you guys remember the theme of this week, it was “Holiday Bounce” We’re at 68% of the 3POOL. Insert meme “+1%”. The FraxBasedPool is $450.4M versus 3pool's $663M. The basedpool saw a decrease of 1% in TVL. But what’s more troubling is that there’s an imbalance in the FraxBP pool right now of nearly a 25/75 split between USDC/FRAX but since the slippage is manageable the Frax team hasn’t rebalance the pool yet. Also note that the Frax3CRV pool is ABOVE the FraxBP. This is the first time it’s flipped since it passed the Frax3CRV. We need to monitor the situation. Moving on, let’s chat about our metapools. Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP. We had a significant bounce this week of 17% up to $44M. We got as low as $38M last week so I’m glad to see this relief bounce. Any projects out there looking to work with the Metapool, please join the Flywheel pod TG chat and DM any of the hosts for assistance. Also one quick note, we also have an additional $12.8M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. Surprisingly, the non-stable pairs TVL was pretty much unchanged for the week. So adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $57.2M of liquidity paired against FraxBP, 12.4% increase. Please continue uponly next week please! Summary time. Liquidity Check. FraxBP is 450.4M which is 68% of 3Pool. The MetaPool is at $44M for stable pairs. And TVL of All pairs (stables + non-stables) are at $57.2M. Lastly, the main reason why we track all of this is to make sure the FRAX supply could grow as big as possible. This week we're at 1.018B, which is a -0.5% move. We’re flirting with that 9-figure digit line and I don’t like it. We need to keep our eyes on the prize and grow this number. But expect this number to go down a bit, IF the Frax team decides to rebalance the Curve AMO and the FraxBP. ",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/holiday-bounce-fraxcheck-17

74,"16149 Bitcoin priced at $1000 each. Seems like a steal right? Thanks for reading Flywheelpod! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support our work. This should be the greatest arbitrage of all time with Bitcoin at $16k. Unfortunately, the Wrapped Sollet BTC (soBTC) on the Solana network is yet another victim of the FTX fraud. After the company revealed that it was insolvent and had entered into a non-binding LOI for purchase with Binance, investors rapidly dumped the now unbacked and probably worthless token.  Now with FTX in Chapter 11 bankruptcy, its surprising that soBTC is trading as high as it is. At this early stage of the proceedings, there is too much uncertainty around how senior soBTC claims will be. If soBTC is treated like a user deposit on the exchange, then the recovery amount might be significant. However, if the soBTC is deemed less senior than user deposits, holders of the now insolvent asset might only receive pennies on the dollar. The current pricing at less than 90% of BTCs price probably suggest the latter, however, as the bankruptcy proceedings unfold, soBTC’s seniority in its money claim will be made clear. Additionally, it might take years or decades to recoup any funds. What a mess. Wrapped assets are debt instruments. The buyer is entering into a contract with the custodian/issuer whereby the latter is promising to ensure redemptions on demand. It’s practically similar to the method used by Circle and Tether when they issue their stablecoins. Wrapped assets should never face solvency risk. It was a general failure at the operator and regulatory level to protect individuals against the fraud of FTX that allowed comingling of customer assets held on chain. FTX screwed up an incredible amount legally. It blows my mind that they did not create a fully separate entity for soBTC in which custodied assets were not co-mingled with whatever was happening with Alameda. All of this is in hindsight though. Before the collapse the warning signs were there. The amount of Bitcoin on FTX dropped rapidly after the 3AC/Luna collapse. At the time people thought that the Bitcoin was just moved to other wallets, but in reality it was loaned to Alameda to cover their losses. At a minimum, all issuers of wrapped crypto assets that are centralized and incorporated must be legally bound to protect and not commingle assets. This is basic financial structuring. Companies should not be able to issue wrapped assets and rehypothecate collateral. There are a few lessons that we can learn from this debacle (other than what the bankruptcy attorneys are dealing with) The biggest problem with soBTC was that it had no qualified custodian. FTX was co-mingling customer funds with Alameda. This caused the mess we are in now because the Bahamanian regulators refused to do their job and allowed FTX to set up and run their company in a way which enabled fraud. Their reputation as a competent regulator will be ruined for years. “Custody in America” can be the shining vision of institutional trust and security for the future. Losing custody of trillions of dollars of assets to overseas venues that have minimal (zero) risk controls, asset protections, and security setups is a huge loss for the industry. American investors flocked to FTX because it had lax onboarding rules and welcomed most any fund to come trade on their books. We now know why. When you buy crypto on an exchange you aren’t buying actual tokens. You get an IOU from the company that they will pay you back at a later date. Most exchanges that aren’t trying to steal from you will credit the funds to your account and place a hold on assets to ensure 1:1 backing with the IOU. In the wake of this too real to be true story, the Canadian regulators made all of these IOU contracts securities. It didn’t matter whether the underlying assets were commodities like Bitcoin if held in a non-custodial wallet. On the exchange it's an IOU. A debt instrument… which is an investment contract and strictly regulated by the SEC. JP Konig noted that If exchanges can’t meet these basic standards for market operations, they shouldn’t be able to operate…. Anywhere. Remember, not your keys, not your crypto. On exchange = everything a security… Defi = maybe. Once assets go off exchange, the token swaps to the wrapped IOU. These tokens shouldn’t be securities on chain, but offchain definitely. Banks are some of the most highly regulated entities outside of nuclear power plants and toxic waste dumps. For good reason too. The same malfeasance perpetrated at FTX was yet another telling of a story of fraud, only with different characters. In 2011, MF Global, a global financial derivatives broker, fell into bankruptcy after it was discovered they had used customer funds to paper holes in their leveraged loan book. The flavor of their story is the closest to FTXs. MFGlobal made a lot of bad, leveraged bets. They tried to hide the losses. Eventually they dipped into client funds to plug the hole. Nothing worked and their fraud was ultimately discovered. The beauty of crypto is that every single token can be accounted for at all times. Just look at the glassnode chart below. All of the onchain data leading to FTX’s collapse was public to see. Billions of dollars of Bitcoin flowed out of FTX months before their collapse. No one commented on it until the Coindesk article because Sam was the golden boy and was thought to have cash on the side to back it all. Going forward, we need to demand that all crypto financial third party brokers need to attest and prove they have control over their assets on a block by block basis. This isn’t hard. It doesn’t degrade security, nor does it invite hackers. Exchanges must attest to the soundness of their reserves by publishing all exchange controlled hot and cold wallets. The total amount of crypto in these wallets should at all times add up to the total customer liabilities held on exchange. One of stories recounted about SBF from multiple sources was that Alameda never could balance their book at the end of the day. While difficult, they could never say exactly how much they profited or lost. Gross negligence and accounting allowed SBF and crew to siphon off funds thinking they were still fully backed. This shouldn’t ever be allowed to happen again. We need real-time proof-of reserve monitoring systems in place run by independent third party validators to track balances. These need to be up to date at best block by block, otherwise within the shortest given period of time that allows for accurate synchronization of the exchanges back end with the reserve wallet balances. For these wrapped crypto products it’s essential to maintain clear attestations. If ever the delta between on-chain analytics and the exchange’s official attestations diverge by more than a few basis points over a 24 hour period regulators should step in and rectify all inaccuracies. Keeping track of all of the assets in custody should not be hard or opaque. We deserve better. There’s no doubt in my mind that this cycle of crypto expansion was fraught due to the incestuous relationships between centralized opaque offshore venues and the networks they provided services for. It was too easy for VC’s to apply the same Web2 models to this new network state. It was a mistake to let founder’s egos drive the narrative. Maybe this is inevitable, as humans naturally latch onto stories and people, rather than code. We can’t let these (and I hate using this term) “first principles” fall by the wayside in the face of juicy VC rounds. ",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/sobitcoin-to-zero-money-moves-7

This week.. I call this week the “Bls make it stop, bls” week. Moment of silence. Let's begin our regular programming with the Peg. We saw it get as low as $0.998 with a high of $1.000 for the week. Peg Check = Strong. We then looked at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We received a 0.9884 exchange rate, which is a decrease of nearly 30 bps compared to last week’s. The Frax team has yet to balance the pool so there’s an imabl of like 75/25 Frax/USDC in the pool right now. Be careful of slippage guys. Moving on we have our Collateralization %. This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. I want to highlight the collateral ratio for the OUTSTANDING FRAX aka non-Frax controlled. A reminder, Frax protocol owns a lot of its own FRAX and theoretically, Frax won’t ever redeem its own underlying collateral backing so the only real collateral ratio we should monitor is that of the OUTSTANDING FRAX, which currently sits at 87.5%. Following we have the Decent %. We are slightly off the lows with a 13.1%, which is an 1.8% increase from last week’s Frax Check. V v v v much bear market vibes across the board when it comes to these two metrics. We want to see the Collat % going back to the low 80s and the Decent % going back to 30s. Okay. Quick summary Health Check. Peg Good. Curve Swap mmmmm. Collat % could be better. Decent % lil bounce from ATL. Next, we have our new segment of the check where we look at FrxETH. As always, we check the peg. Peg check here is strong you see the price delta is only 0.0001 between frxETH and ETH. We obvs have to go into the market and check this ourselves and you see here that I tried to do a 8905 ETH swap which is about $10M and I get an exchange rate of 0.9861. That’s kinda ish good. Also, last week we had 38% of the frxETH staked in the Curve pool, and now we have 65% of the supply inside curve. The APY as per Convex is at 10% projected. Littttt. That’s why everyone is here. Let’s see what the count looks like this week. The count is at 17,038. And look at that chart, I know you can’t read it but just appreciate the verticalness off that graph. +185%. Hot. On the staked side we see that 34% of all the frxETH is being staked to earn the ETH native staking rewards, which is 5-7% but since only a third of frxETH is staked we can multiply that 5-7% by 3x. Let’s do a quick summary check. Peg check strong. Curve swap strong. Count up only. Staked healthy. Let's jump into the AMO Holdings. We have a grand total of $502.7M across all the AMOs. This was a increase of 18.5% compared to last week. PAIN. The Curve AMO increased by nearly $85M. These are wicked AMO moves. Onto the profitability of the Curve AMO. We’re now at $1.151M in Revenue for the month of November. We paid roughly $1.28M in bribes so far plus about $430k in expenses, our loss is at $200k right now. There’s some oddities going on cuz the Nov 14th bribe expense isn’t pulling in properly so I need to do a check at month end for proper accounting but I expect this to be our first down month. RIP November.  Quick summary money check. AMO holdings was $502M, +18.5% WoW. Profitability, we’re down $200k, though I expect us to be at a loss for this month in November. So lets see how November fairs. Here's my favorite section of the Frax Check. The Liquidity Check. Do you guys remember the theme of this week, it was BLS MAKE IT STOP. We’re at 65% of the 3POOL. Insert meme “it’s ded already”. The FraxBasedPool is $449.5M versus 3pool's $688M. The basedpool saw a decrease of -3.7% in TVL. But what’s more troubling is that there’s an imbalance in the FraxBP pool right now of nearly a 25/75 split between USDC/FRAX that needs to be rectified. So expect the FraxBP to decrease even more but note here that the Frax3CRV pool is about equal to the FraxBP. This is the first time it’s getting this close since it passed the Frax3CRV. We need to monitor the situation. Moving on, let’s chat about our metapools. Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP. We pretty much retraced all of our momentum for the last 12 weeks. We’re currently at $43.9M, which is a 35% decrease WoW. Any projects out there looking to work with the Metapool, please join the Flywheel pod TG chat and DM any of the hosts for assistance. Also one quick note, we also have an additional $11.3M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. Surprisingly, the non-stable pairs TVL didn’t go down much at all (10% ish) when compared to the stable pairs. What is going on?!?! So adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $55M of liquidity paired against FraxBP, 31% decrease, down horrendous. Please resume uponly next week please! Summary time. Liquidity Check. FraxBP is 449.5M which is 65% of 3Pool. The MetaPool is at $43.9M for stable pairs, marking a 35% decrease over last week. And TVL of All pairs (stables + non-stables) are at $55.2M. Lastly, the main reason why we track all of this is to make sure the FRAX supply could grow as big as possible. This week we're at 1.178B, which is a -0.1% move, pretty much unchanged. We need to keep our eyes on the prize and grow this number. But expect this number to go down a bit from us rebalancing the Curve AMO and the FraxBP.

Peg Check = Strong. We then looked at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We switched it up since the FraxBP is now larger than the Frax3CRV. We received a 0.9912 exchange rate, which is a decrease of nearly 80 bps compared to last week’s. We saw a MASSIVE outflow of USDC from the FraxBP over the week and I must say, I’m impressed with the swap rate. Though, losing 80bps isn’t great cuz that’s still $800k in a $100M swap.

Also one quick note, we also have an additional $12.3M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. So adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $80M of liquidity paired against FraxBP, 28% decrease, down bad. Please resume uponly next week please! Summary time. Liquidity Check. FraxBP is 467M which is 74% of 3Pool. The MetaPool is at $68M for stable pairs, marking a 27% decrease over last week. And TVL of All pairs (stables + non-stables) are at $80M. Lastly, the main reason why we track all of this is to make sure the FRAX supply could grow as big as possible. This week we're at 1.179B, which is a 3.6%. We need to keep our eyes on the prize and grow this number. But expect this number to go down a bit from us rebalancing the Curve AMO and the FraxBP.

77,"Welcome to Frax Check. Your weekly frax vibe check. I am your host Kapital K. As always, I'm joined by my co-host Defi Dave and our producer extraordinaire Sam. We will be going straight to the source of truth via checking the chain. Before we jump in, please subscribe to the flywheelpod and follow us @flywheelpod on twitter and tg. This week.. I call this week the “Run It Back, Turbo” week. And you’ll see what I mean. I got some new new for the real real ones out there today. Hope you guys enjoyed our Halloween special with Scupy Trooples, if you haven’t you can check it out in the link here and in the notes. Let's begin our regular programming with the Peg. We saw it get as low as $0.999 with a high of $1.000 for the week. Peg Check = Strong. We then took a look at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We switched it up since the FraxBP is now larger than the Frax3CRV. We received a 0.9992 exchange rate, which is pretty much unchanged compared to last week’s. Moving on we have our Collateralization %. This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. So I did something a little different this week. Shoutout to Seba here for putting together a dashboard that highlights the collateral ratio for the OUTSTANDING FRAX aka non-Frax controlled. A reminder, Frax protocol owns a lot of its own FRAX and theoretically, Frax won’t ever redeem its own underlying collateral backing so the only real collateral ratio we should monitor is that of the OUTSTANDING FRAX, which currently sits at 90.9%. I’ve included the previously used Collateral Ratio for ALL of the FRAX, which is at 93.25%. Following we have the Decent %. We are unchanged at 14.5% from lats week. Still relatively close to ATL. V v v v much bear market vibes across the board when it comes to these two metrics. We want to see the Collat % going back to the low 80s and the Decent % going back to 30s. Okay. Quick summary Health Check. Peg Good. Curve Swap Good. Collat % could be better Decent % low. Now. Here’s that surprise I had in store for you guys. This is a new segment that I’ll be adding going forward in all Frax Check. And today’s theme was “Run it back turbo” so I gotta share with you guys how Frax is gonna be running it back turbo with new stablecoin, FrxETH. As always, we check the peg. But before that, quick shoutout to the homie Struct3r who built this dashboard. Frax community is the coolest. Join us in telegram @flywheelpod on telegram. So let’s dive in. Peg check here is strong you see the price delta is only 6 bps between frxETH and ETH. We obvs have to go into the market and check this ourselves and you see here that I tried to do a 400 ETH swap which is essentially the whole pool and I get an exchange rate of 0.9661. That’s pretty dam good for taking out all the liquidity. Also, we currently have 12.5% of the frxETH staked in the Curve pool. Let’s look at what the count looks like. The count is at 3,355. And look at that chart, I know you can’t read it but just appreciate the verticalness off that graph. Hot. On the staked side we see that 84% of all the frxETH is being staked to earn the ETH native staking rewards, which is 5-7%. But because only 84% is staked the yield is a little higher. Now this begs the question, why is that 12.5% of frxETH folks is in the Curve pool earning basically 0.30% APR when they can be earning 5-7% here. I think it’s because they want to position themselves when the flywheel is turned on. The frxeth/ETH gauge got approved recently and we’re gonna see the party starting real soon. And I’d imagine there may be an imbalance between the frxETH/ETH pool so maybe the early birds don’t wanna be hit with the slippage when the pool is imbalanced. Okay. Let’s do a quick summary check. Peg check strong. Curve swap strong. Count up only. Staked healthy. Let's jump into the AMO Holdings. We have a grand total of $611M across all the AMOs. This was a increase of 20 bps compared to last week. All other AMOs remained largely unchanged. Onto the profitability of the Curve AMO. We’re now at $2.49M in Revenue for the month of October. We’re at a breakeven for the month of Oct. I’m so glad we barely made the cutoff here. Granted, I didn’t put in the votium bribes that were due yesterday on 10/31 and imma count that for November. Quick summary money check. AMO holdings was $611M, +20bps WoW. Profitability, we’re pretty much breakeven. So lets see how November fairs. Here's my favorite section of the Frax Check. The Liquidity Check. Did I mention we’re in the RUN IT BACK TURBO mode. We’re at 95% of the 3POOL. The FraxBasedPool is $735M versus 3pool's $774. The basedpool saw an increase of 8.4% in TVL. Hotness hotness hotness. I’m not gonna stop there. Let’s check out the metapools baby. As I said, the party don’t stop, let’s cheers to the metapools. Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP. The Metapools just hit a new ATH of $100M, a 24% increase WoW. We flew pass $90M and straight up broke $100M. 9 FIGURE CLUB BABY. Let’s see if we can keep this going. Any projects out there looking to work with the Metapool, please join the Flywheel pod TG chat and DM any of the hosts for assistance. Also one quick note, we also have an additional $11.6M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. So adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $111.6M of liquidity paired against FraxBP, a 23% WoW growth. Clap yall. Summary time. Liquidity Check. FraxBP is 735M which is 95% of 3Pool. The MetaPool is at $100M for stable pairs, marking a 24% increase over last week. And TVL of All pairs (stables + non-stables) are at $111.6M. Lastly, the main reason why we track all of this is to make sure the FRAX supply could grow as big as possible. This week we're unchanged. I’m sorry to climax at such a meh point but this is important to highlight for us. We need to keep our eyes on the prize and grow this number.  ",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/frax-check-12

79,"Watch the full episode at the end of the article Bitcoin is just money, a shiny digital rock used solely to pass perceived value back and forth between two addresses. Bitcoiners maximize trust and transactional capability above all. Network functions are limited to ensure anyone can run a full node, transforming it into a hardened digital bunker designed to survive any attack. But at the same time, Bitcoin is not meant to be innovated upon. Changes to the protocol are slow, scarce, and methodical, as to not break the singular core function.  There is no real answer as to whether this is the right method to build a blockchain. Entire digital religions have sprung up denouncing heretical evolutionaries who might enact other networks in the face of Bitcoin. I always found these arguments to be lacking, as innovation typically precludes incumbents from lasting unless their model of existence is airtight in every regard. Sreeram Kannan, founder of Eigenlayer was our guest this week. We interviewed him for almost 2 hours and he opened up to us in detail about his larger thoughts on the value systems for distributed networks. During the interview Sreeram told us: Finding Ethereum for me was a watershed moment because of the ideas mentioned above. Ethereum was the first distributed network to separate trust and innovation. First miners, now validators secure trust in the network, allowing for the ""surface area of permissionless innovation” to expand. Any anon can build on top of Ethereum services that the entire world can use and no one can be discriminated against. L2s further reduced the costs needed to bootstrap and maintain security, allowing for even more innovation to take place. It’s a paradigm shift in how we build digital products.  Eigenlayer is transformative, potentially more than any other alt-L1 or middleware protocol as it stands to completely separate trust and innovation, thus opening the door to anyone to try and construct novel applications, protocols and networks. In a couple of years we could look back on this time and wonder how the alt-L1 explosion of the early 2020’s ever could have happened with the current technology infinitely expanding the “surface area of innovation” for Ethereum. Eigenlayer is not a threat to existing systems, rather it will create a new competitive trust environment that hopefully will transform distributed networks to be vastly more efficient and secure.  Eigenlayer was founded by Sreeram Kannan, a faculty member at the University of Seattle, where he previously researched computational biology. Sreeram was always interested in distributed systems. He wrote his PhD thesis on P2P wireless systems in 2006, but the idea never really took off. Wireless infrastructure won out for its reliability and data speed. So after his PhD, he switched to computational genomics, completing his postdoc studies at Berkeley and Stanford, and then moving to Washington where he eventually became a faculty member. It wasn’t until 2018 that he started to really dive into crypto, when one of his previous advisors called him and asked him if he had heard of Bitcoin. The rest was just him falling down the crypto rabbit hole until he came up with the idea for Eigenlayer. Eigenlayer is a natural extension of Sreeram’s mental model of the world. These model define how he sees humanity, existence, and what it means to be human. One of his core mental models is based on Yuval Noah Harari’s book Sapiens, which argues that humanity’s  defining evolutionary advantage that allowed them to take over this planet is our ability to cooperate flexibly in large numbers. For any other species, there is an element of wide societal trust missing, and this creates friction to cooperation. If these blockages can be reduced, groups can grow massively by means of cooperation.  Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are a new form of internet native innovations changing the world. Instead of information, they are a cooperation superhighway. Any person connected to the internet can now access these distributed value systems in a permissionless manner. Sreeram’s big application of his mental model was using the idea of the internet to make the jump to blockchain and crypto. He decided to upgrade the velocity of cooperation and hopefully accelerate the rate of innovation globally. So he dropped everything and moved over to crypto. The paradigm of innovation is that a “genius” comes up with a new idea and revolutionizes the field. But in reality, innovation is much more like evolution than intelligent design. People do science around different ideas, giving it a fitness, and then those ideas compete. The best ideas win and the process repeated. So once you have that mental model (Sreeram is all about mental models), the way you let innovation flourish is by letting many people compose pieces of innovation on top of each other. As I mentioned above, the most amazing thing about Ethereum is how it separated trust and innovation. Before blockchains, innovators faced uphill battles to build networks of trust. Attracting attention and getting funding is incredibly hard. You have to sell your vision to a select group of kingmakers (VCs) who take a cut of your business permanently in return for capital. The very nature of this process creates a required highly centralized and regulated financial system to remove trust issues. With distributed systems, however, users only have to trust the underlying network security if they believe the code is good. This is what Sreeram calls a “mind-bending” concept. Only with Ethereum-like networks is this possible. Sreeram noted this innovation was on the the same level of venture capital, which separates innovation and capital. People with ideas get together with people with capital. They both work together and create something new. This has led to huge growth over the last 70 years. Crypto radically changes the entry points into the system, rather than having to attend an Ivy League, work at a top firm, or know the right investors, any random anon can publish code that anyone in the world can consume. Sreeram said that unlike Google’s motto of “Don’t be evil,” for crypto the motto is “can’t discriminate,” as you don’t need to know who the end user is. The trust comes from the network, not the user, intermediary or government. In the first few years of Ethereum, the idea was to use sharding to expand network capabilities. But market forces eventually shuttered this idea, and the core dev team listened, giving into demands for L2 rollups. This paradigm shift was natural and market driven. It was the right choice and now L2s are the bedrock for Ethereum’s future. Eigenlayer in the next evolution of this scaling idea, moving beyond rollups to a full open trust layer that anyone can innovate on.  Everything that Eigenlayer is planning to rollout is fully dependent on the recent Proof of Stake transition, as now trust is programmable. Proof of Work is great for hardening network security, but its impossible to build in negative incentives to miners other than incorrect mining. You can’t slash in PoW, you can only fight to get block rewards. With PoS though, there is both a carrot and a stick; validators earn staking rewards, but they also can be slashed if they execute blocks incorrectly.  Functioning civilizations, in this case digital ones, need both positive and negative incentives to keep their populations in line. In the real world, we have monetary rewards for working, and also jail time and fines for perpetrating criminal acts. Before the switch the PoS, there was no way to punish someone for incorrectly publishing oracle feeds or data storage information. PoS now allows for programatic trust to be added to any validator who accepts.  Now, when you want to join Eigenlayer, you must choose which services to run. If you choose a compliance chain and you hate any and all censorship and refuse to validate certain blocks, your stake will be slashed. Same goes for any other network that is apart of Eigenlayer, they create rules on how the system should operate, and if the stakers refuse or incorrectly produce blocks, a penalty is assessed.  In our interview with ChainLinkGod, he said that Eigenlayer wasn’t a threat to existing networks with communities at large. He’s right, Eigenlayer isn’t a panacea. New ideas still have to be competent to execute on their idea and also to build communities. What it enables though is greater competition, as no incumbent protocol will have an advantage anymore solely due to its validator set and stake.  So how do you bootstrap a new protocol on Day 1 with Eigenlayer? Well the Ethereum restakers are already earning 5-6% native ETH yield. They then will be able to opt in to whichever services they want on Eigenlayer. Just like during DeFi summer, a new protocol can launch and offer a token in return for security. The token might be worthless at first, but some restakers might take the chance that it could be worth something someday.  Unlike in DeFi, the risks to the restakers are smaller, as they are committed to their ETH stake and don’t mind price fluctuations. They just want to be sure they are earning more ETH or yield. It’s a different risk category, so there should be an easier uptake to Eigenlayer than with DeFi.  Eigenlayer can support new L1s, middleware, and even smaller projects which never would have made sense to build before. There’s a weird paradox for Eigenlayer, that as more apps and protocols are secured by Ethereum restakers, the network grows more resilient. Sreeram noted that blockchains are like nation-states, and dapps are like cities. Dapps get their security from the nation-state, they don’t protect themselves. It would be strange if each city or department of the government had its own independent police force and military. You can’t run a country this way, you need an integrated security force. Once you secure your own nation, you can export your security to other nations in partnerships like NATO or the UN.  What this means for Eigenlayer is that once an oracle is launched, its data is secured by all of the Ethereum restakers supporting it. It can now provide its price feed services to any blockchain or any network. Ethereum stakers are planning to run expensive validator nodes for other networks like Solana or Aptos, but they can provide middleware services backed by the highest network security in existence. So a new L1 can bootstrap immediately all these cool services without having to build it themselves. Ethereum becomes, as Sreeram calls it, “a net exporter of security. Eventually, all of the technical arbitrage between L1s is removed and what’s left are the strongest communities and most innovative teams.  Sreeram wants to use Eigenlayer to create a new commons, where anyone can build on top of other creators in a non-permissioned way. He thinks the ideal system would basically have a “permissionless innovation license.” This would allow creators and builders to innovate on top of previous works, creating new derivatives, all while paying fees back to the original creator as attribution. In this sense, we can move past existing copyright models that inhibit growth and creativity, instead working towards a more transparent and open society where the pace of innovation is constantly accelerated.  It’s the same model as we described earlier with the cranes and skyhook. Sreeram wants more cranes, and also more incentives to build more cranes. It’s all about mental models and Eigenlayer is truly poised to drive the next wave of innovation in crypto.  ",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/frxeth-a-new-challenger-emerges

I’m speechless... Warning. Be prepared for pain. I call this week the “It’s not about getting knocked down, but about how you pick yourself back up” week. And you’ll see what I mean. Thanks for reading Flywheelpod! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support our work. Let's begin our regular programming with the Peg. We saw it get as low as $0.998 with a high of $1.000 for the week. Peg Check = Strong. We then took a look at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC. We switched it up since the FraxBP is now larger than the Frax3CRV. We received a 0.9990 exchange rate, which is pretty much unchanged compared to last week’s but still better than the Frax3CRV pool. Moving on we have our Collateralization %. This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral. With the market bumping like it is, I’m surprised that our Collat % actually WENT UP! Like WTF. We hit a new ATH of 93.3%. Not great yall. Following we have the Decent %. We saw a new ATL last week but luckily we bounced up to 14.5%, which is a 2.3% increase from the low. V v v v much bear market vibes across the board when it comes to these two metrics. We want to see the Collat % going back to the low 80s and the Decent % going back to 30s. Okay. Quick summary Health Check. Peg Good. Curve Swap Good. Collat % hitting new ATH of 93.3%. Decent % bounced from ATLs. Let's jump into the AMO Holdings. We have a grand total of $610M across all the AMOs. This was a decrease of 8.4% compared to last week. MASSIVE dump from the Curve AMO, losing about $50M of liquidity. Not sure where it went but this is foreshadowing that stablecoin TVL may be going down so maybe bull market? Resume up only? Nothing much changed from the other 3 AMOs. Onto the profitability of the Curve AMO. We’re now at $2.0M in Revenue for the month of October. We’re at a loss of $0.45M for the month of Oct, but luckily we don’t have to pay the votium bribes for another week so we’re gonna get to rake in some dough for the rest of October. Happy Halloween, this is def a treat not a trick. Steady lads, deploying treats. Quick summary money check. AMO holdings was $610M, -8% WoW. Slight cloudiness in the horizon for stablecoins TVL, but maybe bullish for risk assets? Profitability we’re down as of this Frax Check but expect a positive number for the month of October. Here's my favorite section of the Frax Check. The Liquidity Check. My fellow Fraximalist... my brethren and my sistren! To use the wise words of Aristotle, we down horrendous. We’re at 86% of the 3POOL. I know. I know. We held on for so many weeks and the floor opened from beneath us. But I will not leave us here. Come, let’s muster up our courage and relish in the challenge. The FraxBasedPool is $678.7M versus 3pool's $785.9M. The basedpool saw a decrease of -17.3% in TVL, while the 3POOL say a slightly less severe drop in TVL. However, the FraxBasedPool is still much larger than the Frax3CRV pool, nearly 20% larger. Tune in next week to watch the revenge tour – maybe. As I said, I will not leave us below in the pit of dark abyss, let’s rejoice with the metapools. Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP. The Metapools just hit a new ATH of $80.9M, a near 20% increase WoW. We flew pass $70M and straight up broke $80M. Let’s see if we can keep this going. Any projects out there looking to work with the Metapool, please join the Flywheel pod TG chat and DM any of the hosts for assistance. Also one quick note, we also have an additional $9.6M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. So adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $90.5M of liquidity paired against FraxBP, a 16% WoW growth. Clap yall. Summary time. Liquidity Check. FraxBP is 678.7M which is 86% of 3Pool. The MetaPool is at $80.9M for stable pairs, marking a 20% increase over last week. And TVL of All pairs (stables + non-stables) are at $90M. Lastly, the main reason why we track all of this is to make sure the FRAX supply could grow as big as possible. Guys and gals, I’ve warned you at the beginning of this Frax Check. Do you remember the warning? Be prepared for pain. This week we're down 10.8%. We’re at $1.21B from 1.36B. ",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/down-bad-but-frxeth-gaining-steam

I’m not going to make a comment on it but simply here to remind everyone all the other charts that we should be looking at. I call this week, “keep your eyes on the ball” week. And you’ll see what I mean. Let's begin our regular programming with the Peg. We saw it get as low as $0.998 with a high of $1.000 for the week. Peg Check = Strong.

Let's jump into the AMO Holdings. We have a grand total of $666M across all the AMOs. This was a decrease of 1.3% compared to last week. Not too big of a dump but this week’s drop is attributable to Liquidity AMO which dropped a hot $10M. This is the AMO that manages Frax, FXS liquidity across the Uniswap, Sushiswap, Fraxswap, etc. And the Curve AMO has remained flat for the last 2-3 weeks so not great. Onto the profits. The Frax Team did indeed call the claim function over this past week and we’re now at $1.3M in Revenue for the month of October. But we just prepaid the Votium bribes yesterday so we’re back in the negative for the month so far. We’re at a loss of $1.2M for the month of Oct, but remember the CRV and CVX rewards are going to keep flowing in for the next 2 weeks so steady lads, deploying more profits. Quick summary money check. AMO holdings was $666M, -1.3% WoW. Slight cloudiness in the horizon. Here's my favorite section of the Frax Check. The Liquidity Check. My fellow Fraximalist... we are… MAINTAINING THE GAP! We’re keeping at 98% of the 3POOL, we were 98% last week. The FraxBasedPool is $820M versus 3pool's $836M. The basedpool saw a decrease of -1.7% in TVL, while the 3POOL say a similar drop in TVL. The BasedPool is 98% of 3Pool. However, the FraxBasedPool is still much larger than the Frax3CRV pool, nearly 30% larger. Tune in next week to watch the reflippening – maybe. Then let's transition over to the Metapools! Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP. I told yall to stay focus and this is what we should pay extra attention to. The Metapools just hit a new ATH of $67.6M, a 7% increase WoW. We’re holding firmly above $60M for the last 6 weeks. Let’s see if we can keep this going. Any projects out there looking to work with the Metapool, please join the Flywheel pod TG chat and DM any of the hosts for assistance. Also one quick note, we also have an additional $10.4M of TVL from non-stable pairs in the Metapools. These are pairs like cvxfxs/FraxBP and cvxcrv/FraxBP. So adding all of the stables and non-stables TVL, we have a total of $78M of liquidity paired against FraxBP. Clap yall. Summary time. Liquidity Check. FraxBP is 820M which is 98% of 3Pool. The MetaPool is at $67.6M for stable pairs, marking a 7% increase over last week. And TVL of All pairs (stables + non-stables) are at $78M. Lastly, the main reason why we track all of this is to make sure the FRAX supply could grow as big as possible.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/good-frax-vibes-only-frax-check-10
82,"After a three year hiatus, the Ethereum community has reunited in Bogota, Colombia for the 6th edition of Devcon. This year’s event comes in the wake of a two-year bull run that has onboarded more people on-chain than ever before and a successful merge that went off without a hitch. It was clear the themes that the Ethereum Foundation were trying to push throughout the conference. From the opening presentation to the stickers on the tables, one thing they wanted to get across was how Ethereum’s carbon footprint with Proof of Stake is now a speck of sand compared to Proof of Work. In addition, choosing a location in Latin America reaffirms their efforts to make sure that Ethereum is not just a novelty for the privileged but a reliable tool no matter who or where you are. Yet, most impressed (and terrified) me about the conference were the threats, both existentially and culturally, that face Ethereum today. Threats are nothing new but what is is the scale at which they shadow over the network and the amount of people and companies that would be affected by them. One of the most visible concerns at the moment was pointed out by Eric Wall surrounding censorship. Currently, the domination of MEV-boosted Flashbots which are OFAC compliant since the Tornado Cash ban has resulted in 51% of blocks being censored at a validator level. To put into perspective how extreme this move is, not even SWIFT which is the encrypted messaging protocol used by financial institutions around the world are even OFAC-compliant. Having censorship at such a core level of the Ethereum network would lead down a slippery slope that is no better than the freezing of bank accounts. Thanks for reading Flywheelpod! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Wall encourages the Ethereum community to take a note from their Bitcoin counterparts who dealt with a similar issue 5 years ago. As blocks were at risk being only handled by major entities, a pseudonymous developer named Shaolinfry reminded the community that soft fork rules are actually always enforced by the nodes not the miners. This led to the Bitcoin community to rally around UASF (User Activated Soft Fork) which ultimately took power from miners back to the people. In the case of Ethereum, Wall strongly encourages the community to take a similar grassroots approach, categorizing the refusal to submit blocks as the equivalent of a double-spend attack and to penalize the validator appropriately via slashing their stake. If both pieces of legislation are enacted, crypto will be a water-down version of itself that was once promised to the world. Spelliscy does offer several solutions including funding crypto public goods that create jobs which would make unwarranted legislation much less popular. In addition, he advocates for participation in industry associations, funding of think tanks and advocacy groups, lobbying directly, and supporting crypto legal defense funds. At the end of the day, education and clear communication which has been a weak point for crypto since its genesis. In his presentation, linguist Oliver JL Renwick made the strong case how negative framing permeates Web3 which is at best edgy and cool but at worst confusing and cringe. The negative framing stems from crypto’s countercultural cypherpunk roots which often positions itself as adversarial to the status quo. While oftentimes technical development gets the spotlight, what often is forgotten is how important clear communication of important concepts is. He instead encourages crypto to adopt more empowering language and inviting terms for those who may not be familiar with crypto. Overall, what I took away from Devcon is the amount of work that needs to be done to improve the “soft sciences” surrounding crypto. The way we describe and articulate the space to the outside world has a downstream impact. A more positive framing of concepts will lead to a more diverse range of talent entering crypto and clearer communication of the economical benefits of crypto will result in friendlier legislation.

83,"Thanks for reading Flywheelpod! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support our work. Frax has merged the three major pillars of DeFi, swapping, lending, and money markets into one product stack: Liquidity providers can also benefit a boost up to 100% on the yield earned on specific Frax based LP tokens (stable and volatile pairs that have a gauge). Generally between 4 veFXS and 2 veFXS per 1 FRAX in LP are required to earn the max boost. As an example, the POL in the curve AMO acts as a “floor” for FRAX to allow buying and selling on the open market that won’t drop the FRAX price by more than 1%. The AMO is configured to allow no more than 1% drop of the peg before recollaterizing (the docs describe well the whole functioning of the AMO). The different AMOs generate fees and rewards in the various governance tokens where POL is deployed. The rewards earned by the AMOs bring the total value of Frax’s treasury above the Collateral Ratio. All of the excess value is used to do buybacks of FXS on the market and redistribute them to the veFXS holders. Frax also uses its cash flow to bribe vlCVX holders on Votium in order to deepen liquidity for FRAX pairs on Curve. When the activity is high in defi or there is high demand for FRAX, the yield can be pretty juicy. Since the demand is pretty stable currently, veFXS APY mainly depends on the velocity of FRAX in the market. The Frax protocol allows users to access the best yields for stablecoins thanks to Frax’s CVX voting power (they are the #1 holder of vlCVX) and a decent amount of liquidity to be flexible. A profitable strategy for users who want to be long ETH and earn yield is the following: Lend ETH on Fraxlend and borrow Frax. Then, choose a pool that matches your risk profile on the staking page, and provide liquidity. Stake the LP tokens and collect the rewards. For Fraximalists, relock the FXS rewards as veFXS. Fraxswap was not involved in this example but you can swap rewards tokens to ETH for auto-compounding per example, or in another strategy, swap borrowed FRAX to WETH to get leverage. That’s why I call it the Frax Trinity Stack. An all-in-one app. You’re using an equivalent of Aave + Uniswap + DAI in the same platform with some tweaks. That’s pretty awesome and it’s a decisive path to adoption because the first moves of a new defi user will be greatly simplified by using the Frax app. But is there a real advantage to stay in the Frax ecosystem if the yield becomes higher elsewhere (on DAI pools per eg) or if the wind isn’t blowing in the direction of stablecoins? My answer until recently was not so convincing. Yield farming is competitive. Now I’m sure that you’ll not have a better APY elsewhere than in the FRAX ecosystem. What has changed so quickly? It will be a dual token model composed by frxETH and sfrxETH. Provide liquidity on the soon to be launched frxETH-ETH pool on Curve. This pool will be a stable pool, we can consider frxETH like a stablecoin tied to ETH. Stake frxETH to get sfrxETH. Only sfrxETH gets the staking rewards in ETH. The price of sfrxETH will rise as staking rewards accumulate. The floor yield will be equivalent to the staking rewards collected by the Frax validators. What’s really interesting here is that you may get a better yield in the frxETH-ETH pool than with sfrxETH. Frax protocol will redirect a portion of his CVX voting power to this pool, so the emissions + the fees should provide a yield way higher than the 5% ETH staking yield. We can assume that not every frxETH holder will stake to sfrxETH because the yield might be higher in the Curve pool. But all the ETH converted to frxETH will be staked by FRAX into its validators. So sfrxETH should benefit a higher yield than the base staking yield because the total staking rewards gained by frax validators aren’t distributed to all users who converted their ETH to frxETH, but only to those who hold sfrxETH. It can bring convergence between the two yields, and so increase the threshold for sfrxETH staking yield. Why not directly create a sfrxETH-ETH pool? FrxETH is the Defi composable version of the ETH staking derivative. Frax wanted to create a dual token model rather than a wrapped version of the same token due to the rebasing issues of other ETH staking derivatives. Rebasing tokens are harder to integrate in defi protocols because their values change every block, which screws with smart contracts. Let’s go back to the frxETH/ETH pool. We can imagine that this pool will receive a FXS gauge and a potential 2x max boost (you need to lock 4x the amount of your deposit in veFXS to max it). If this pool attracts a lot of veFXS votes, it can be a non negligible bonus on top of the CRV and CVX rewards. Now you can lend ETH and borrow FRAX (Fraxlend) > swap it to ETH (Fraxswap) > stake it to frxETH (Frax product) > deposit it into the curve pool and get potentially +7.5% yield on ETH. There are rumors that Lido will start to acquire CRV or CVX, proving the value of the firepower that Frax has in the Curve wars and the advantage they’ll have every time they jump on a new product involving Curve. Ultimately, a majority of ETH holders might switch to Frax ETH for higher yield in the more composable staking derivative to get more leverage by borrowing more ETH. If Frax keeps the frxETH-ETH peg tight and the yield high, they’ll attract massive market share, expanding the FRAX supply due to leverage on frxETH through Fraxlend. NFA, DYOR.

We will be going straight to the source of truth via checking the chain.  Before we jump in, please subscribe to the flywheelpod and follow us @flywheelpod on twitter and tg. Thanks for reading Flywheelpod! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support our work. This week.. I call it “we’re not down” week.  We gotta celebrate the wins when we get it.  Let's begin our regular programming with the Peg.  We saw it get as low as $0.997 with a high of $1.000 for the week.  Peg Check = Strong.  So quite bullish even with the general market drawdown.   We then took a look at Curve via swapping 100M FRAX for USDC.  We switched it up since the FraxBP is now larger than the Frax3CRV.  We received a 0.9989 exchange rate, which is unchanged compared to last week’s but still better than the Frax3CRV pool.  Moving on we have our Collateralization %.   This is the % that conveys how much FXS (algorithmic) is used as collateral.  With the market drawdown, its expected that the collat % to go up and this week we stayed at the ATH level of 93.0%.  Following we have the Decent %.  We saw an increase of 1.5% from 14.4% to 14.6%.  Slightly, tiny itsy bitsy, “we’re not down” but definitely bear market vibes across the board when it comes to these two metrics.  We want to see the Collat % going back to the low 80s and the Decent % going back to 30s. Okay.  Quick summary Health Check.  Peg Good.  Curve Swap Good.  Collat % flat Week-over-week.  Decent % up. Let's jump into the AMO Holdings.  We have a grand total of $674M across all the AMOs.  This was an increase of nearly 1% compared to last week.  Not too big of a bump but this week’s increase is attributable to Investor AMO increasing by nearly $3M and the Liquidity AMO getting $1M back.  This is the AMO that manages Frax, FXS liquidity across the Uniswap, Sushiswap, Fraxswap, etc.   Onto the profits.  I think the Frax team has NOT claimed their CRV and CVX rewards since we last spoke since the dune dashboard I looked at did not pull any new figures from our last Frax Check.  But we were at a loss of $960k for the month of Oct, but remember that we haven’t claimed the rewards this epoch yet.  So steady lads, deploying more profits. Quick summary money check.  AMO holdings was $674, +1% WoW.  Slight sunshine.  Here's my favorite section of the Frax Check.  The Liquidity Check.  My fellow Fraximalist... we are… CLOSING IN THE GAP!  We’re now 98% of the 3POOL, we were 97% last week.  The FraxBasedPool is $834M versus 3pool's $854M.  The basedpool saw a increase of 0.6% in TVL, while the 3POOL remained basically flat.  The BasedPool is 98% of 3Pool.   However, the FraxBasedPool is still much larger than the Frax3CRV pool, nearly 30% larger.  Tune in next week. Then let's transition over to the Metapools!  Reminder the metapool are pools that are PAIRED with the BasedPool, examples like LUSD/FraxBP.  We saw a modest increase of 1% in the Metapool this week.  We’re holding firmly above $60M for the last 5 weeks.  We normally see a jump in liquidity after a period of consolidation so looking forward to seeing what projects are using the metapool next.   Summary time.  Liquidity Check.  FraxBP is 834M which is 98% of 3Pool.  The MetaPool is at $63.2, marking a 1% increase over last week.  Lastly, the main reason why we track all of this is to make sure the FRAX supply could grow as big as possible.  Fortunately this week we're slightly up by 0.22% at 1.361B.  Hope to see more of this increase to come when FraxLend hits it strides. ",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/live-from-devcon-frax-check-9-oct
85,"In the latest episode of Flywheelpod, Frax Core Dev Jack Corddry sat down and explained a ton about the upcoming launch of Frax’s Ethereum staking derivative. Here’s a summary of all information we learned from that episode. All ETH PoS staking derivatives are just “stablecoins.” Frax is really, really good at creating and managing stablecoins. So Frax to enter the staking derivatives game is not that much of a jump. Thanks for reading Flywheelpod! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. Frax’s Ethereum derivative has a two token design: Converting your ETH to FrxETH does not mean that you are generating yield. Its similar to WETH, an ERC-20, which allows users to access DeFi from Frax and other protocols. When you convert to FrxETH, your ETH is staked in a validator to earn staking yield. WETH is lazy, FrxETH works. Virgin WETH, Chad FrxETH sFrxETH is an ERC-4626 vault. You deposit your sFrxETH to the vault and it receives rewards. When you want to withdrawal back to FrxETH, you receive your ETH plus the staking rewards earned during that time period. The point of the two tokens is to have FrxETH always be 1:1 against ETH and let sFrxETH vary in price based on staking returns. Functionally, the system is similar to Compound’s ctokens, where the ctokens accrue interest and increase in price. Other design like Lido’s stETH is a rebasing token, which are notoriously hard to integrate with smart contracts. Lido does provide a wrapper for stETH, but FrxETh will work immediately at launch. Upon launch FrxETH will be added to Curve ETH/FrxETH pool for liquidity and trading. Additionally it will be added to Fraxlend. This will allow FrxETH access to lending, leverage and trading from Day 1. It’s the DeFi Trinity stack. Get ready for the FrxETH base pool :0 It can be the liquidity hub for all staking derivatives. What happens when FXS is used to bribe the FrxETH metapools? The yield for sFrxETH is expected to be higher than most all other staking derivatives. With other derivatives your just earning staking fees and block proposer rewards. With FrxETH its also hooked into Fraxlend, Curve, Fraxswap, etc. Frax will provide high yields to the ETH/FrxETH curve pool. All of the FrxETH in that pool will also be staked and locked for various time periods. All of the FrxETH will also be in validator nodes earning yield that will go to sFrxETH. This means that sFrxETH stakers should get higher than normal yields because not all the FrxETH is locked up in the staking contract. All of the FrxETH validators are going to be run in house. Testing of the nodes has been ongoing since Summer 2022. Frax has consistently been in the top 1% of validator connectivity and yield. Additionally sFrxETH will earn yield from tips and MEV boost. Frax has pre-setup around 10k validators to satisfy the needs of unlimited demand for FrxETH at launch. Frax plans to charge as little as possible to run the validators to maximize yield for sFrxETH. Jack said that fees could potentially charge less than 10% for MEV, meaning actual fees would be somewhere between 5-10%. Its a pseudo way to bribe more ETH yield! Can we say FrxETH AMOs? So much to come, but FrxETH is poised for greatness. ",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/everything-we-know-about-frxeth-so
86,"Week in review A low key week from Frax. No major announcements, just updates across several products. Thanks for reading Flywheel Output! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. It’s refreshing to see FXS find a lending market again. Two financing options now are open 1.) you can borrow FRAX as debt without having to sell your FXS 2.) You can leverage up on FXS. Option 1 is great if you want to stay long FXS, especially in this bear market. If your price targets for FXS have two or three zeros in them like us at Flywheel, it makes no sense then to sell any of your FXS. It would be extremely unwise and Terra-like for FXS AMO lending to reach a significant level of size to where a drop in FXS price could create a series of cascading liquidations. If the amount borrowed is concentrated into a few large accounts and the LP pool is unable to readily absorb the liquidations, severe negative price impacts from the sell off could threaten the overall health of the FRAX protocol. If the price of FXS drops too quickly it could take the value of the endogenous collateral backing FRAX below what is required to maintain the collateral ratio. Without proper backing, the value of FRAX could fall below $1 and become unrecoverable. The good news there is an easy solution for this problem. AMO funds can and should be limited for the FXS lending pool. This was first brought up by tan on Oct 7 in the chat. He was discussing FIP-116 which would authorize Frax protocol to deploy AMO funds to Fraxlend. Initially the FIP had grouped all three assets together into one vote. After tan voiced their opinions, the FIP was split into three and is now in discussion on the governance forums. [FIP - 116] Authorize Fraxlend AMO for a new pair ( CVX ) [FIP - 117] Authorize Fraxlend AMO for a new pair ( FXS ) [FIP - 118] Authorize Fraxlend AMO for a new pair ( CRV ) The CRV and CVX pools are proposed to receive a maximum allocation of 5mil FRAX each and the FXS pool 1m FRAX. This week, Bankless published their October Token Reviews and Frax was included. One quick look at the report and we were ready to jump on the inconsistencies that were evident throughout it. The most important aspect of the bill is that it could include a potential “ban” on fully uncollateralized stablecoins as a response to the collapse of UST/Terra earlier this year. Based on reporting from Bloomberg, the ban would only affect crypto stablecoins “solely” backed by endogenous collateral. Partially backed stablecoins would be unaffected based on early reports of the draft legislation. Given all this, Jack’s ultimate opinion that he shared with his readers was that the ban would affect FRAX, forcing USDC to freeze all supply connected in any way, even in protocols like Curve, Aave, and every other DeFi platform where Frax is serviced. It wouldn’t matter to him if the USDC was paired with FRAX in LP, or if it was sitting in Aave as liquidity that could be borrowed. Circle would take the scorched earth option of affecting every single major DeFi platform in existence to enforce the ban. I find this viewpoint extreme, chilling to the entire DeFi ecosystem, and grossly out of line with previous enforcement actions. I hate using the word FUD, but in this situation, Jack is so off the ball. Frax’s US footprint is extremely small. No US exchanges have listed FRAX. No US based payment companies are using Frax. Circle has only frozen its assets in the wake of OFAC’s Tornado Cash ban. Jack thinks the draft legislation of 1 of 3 potential stablecoin bills will force Circle to take similar actions it took against Tornado Cash. Bear in mind the US was responding to multiple hacks by the Lazerus group, a North Korean based operation. Jack stated multiple times when questioned on Twitter that the stablecoin bill would force Circle to fully go scorched earth and ban all USDC connected with FRAX on every DeFi platform and on every chain. And they let this guy write for an audience of thousands of people. If political history is to be any sort of guide, a middle path is always found. The worst of these draft bills is left out and what’s included is only what makes industry more resilient and open to growth. If 100% CR is required for Frax, that’s fine, there’s only a 7% gap to be closed. The power of what FRAX is and can do with its AMOs and suite of products is greater than that gap. We hosted an interview with FrxETH core dev Jack Corddry about the upcoming launch of Frax’s native ETH staking product. Jack from The Tie came on FraxCheck this week to discuss his company’s proposal to highlight Frax within their institutional investor tools.

87,"What a week. Vibes have been tough this week, as seen in the price of FXS and FPIS. As usual FRAX is still holding strong at a dollar. At Flywheel, we are of the belief that the Frax team can solve or innovate any techonological problems heading into the future. The core team of developers “Seal Team 8” are some of the smartest minds in the industry and they do one thing very well…. Ship. Our product speaks for itself in terms of quality and speed to market. Going forward into the future, we have no doubts they will continue to push great code. Thanks for reading Flywheel Output! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support our work. However, the final boss in crypto was never going to be code based… It’s this guy And also this guy…. FXS is down 21% since the White House’s framework was released on the 16th, down to $4.20 (shout out Elon) and showing continued weakness going into the weekend. Pairing this drop with the corresponding drop in ETH prices since the Merge has resulted in a staggering 46% drop in FXS in less than 2 months. Like we said at the start…the vibes could be better. The MiCA provisions are a threat to USDC and its issuing company Circle, as it would effectively cut off all stablecoins (USDT, BUSD, Paxos all included!) as a means for payment. While the bill would not cover stablecoins used for trading purposes, thus relieving large exchanges from having to delist all USDC and USDT pairs, it would create an onerous regulatory enviroment that would stifle innovation and potentially leave Europe behind in these new Money Wars. As for Frax, MiCA would have little effect on its operations or growth in our current state. Frax is not listed on any major Centralized exchanges for deposit, withdrawals, or trading and its markets are primarily in DeFi. Over 70% of AMO FRAX is in Curve as liquidity. There is not a market for FRAX outside of DeFi right now. This isn’t a major problem at this stage in Frax’s growth, we must first conquer DeFi and crypto as a transactional currency that people want to hold and use for payments. As long as Frax grows within the confines of crypto, it will be difficult for any regulatory body to ban Frax notwithstanding any sanctions. But it’s for this reason that expectations for the future might be muted or nullified for the current moment. Before Terra’s collapse, several discussions were taking place around funding or integration of Real World Assets (RWAs) into the treasury portfolio or AMO’s. There was a growing sentiment that Frax should diversify its treasury into a hybrid asset mix of on and off-chain yield generating assets. Centrifuge, dAMM, and other RWA protocols were in discussion to partner with Frax before the collapse of Luna. Much like what DAI/Maker is going through right now, the Frax community was starting to have discussions around what would potential RWA loans and partnerships look like. Terra failing like it brought any hopes for branching out back to reality. Until the regulatory environment changes and the potential financial stability threats arising from off-chain liabilities are relieved (if they can be), then the RWA issue is dead for now. We don’t need RWAs right now. We are generating fee revenue in Curve and other protocols with the AMO’s. Unlike Maker, we have a way to put our treasury to use in a maximally profitable manner. We don’t have to rely on Coinbase to provide %1.25 on a small part of the treasury assets. Frax is profitable with no RWAs and in an environment where regulators cannot affect the protocol. I don’t see the forthcoming regulatory regime as a negative for Frax. There might be some backlash against “algorithmic” stablecoins, but we always have the ability to raise the CR to 100%. It won’t mean “wrapped USDC,” rather a suite of products that provide for full collateralization. The addition of Fraxlend + POL is a huge step towards that reality if necessary. I’m actually pretty positive about the new regulations on stablecoins. We need to have greater clarity for USDC and Tether. The growth of crypto is now inexorably linked to these two stablecoins and their success will determine the size of Ethereum TVL in the next decade. Investment funds and other large institutions demand clarity and regulatory safety before allocating. Stablecoins right now sit in a weird gray area and until we have defined rules their circulating supply will not move significantly higher. $200bn across all chains and assets is a drop in the pond, I’d expect the number to move to the trillions if all goes well on the regulatory/legal front. Ohmies unite! Frax is working hard to get you added to Frax lend. This would deepen the existing relationship between the two communities and help drive fur demand for FRAX. We need to acquire as much BTC and ETH lending as possible The latest Gitcoin round just ended and FRAX was one of the largest donors to good causes. We’re using our profits to fund regulatory efforts to protect the protocol. Don’t sleep on FPI. Here’s their conclusion “The current use of a multisig in the governance and management of Frax does pose a risk to Curve, given the value of Frax assets in Curve pools. If Frax were to become compromised, 21.5% of assets on Curve would be at risk, and 32% of CRV emissions would be ineffectively distributed. However, the Frax team is aware the current structure is unsustainable and is implementing a secure and decentralized model that shifts majority control of the protocol to FXS voters. The successful implementation of this new governance model would remove the current risks posed by multisig wallets. A Crypto Risk Assessment completed in December 2021 stated the core team was planning to remove the multisig ""in 3-6 months so that it is purely governance on-chain."" Since this has yet to happen, the core team is currently 3-6 months behind their previous timeline. Given the information described in this report, I believe that the Curve DAO should actively monitor the implementation of the optimistic governance model but take no action now. Suppose the new model is not implemented by December 31, 2022. In that case, the Curve DAO should consider funding a report to investigate why and push the Frax core team to provide an updated timeline on deprecating the multisig. If the implementation is successful, the Curve DAO should consider funding a report to assess the decentralization and security of the new governance model.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/the-rollup-frax-week-in-review-sep
88,"At their core, stablecoin issuers are central banks with the goal of issuing currency at the same rate as demand grows. Success is measured by a protocol’s ability to grow their balance sheet while keeping the stable pegged to a dollar. Thanks for reading Flywheel Output! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. If not through artificial yield, how can an issuer drive demand for new mints? The solution may just lie in lending markets. Enter Fraxlend. Fraxlend is an over-collateralized, permissionless platform that creates lending markets between any two ERC-20 tokens with Chainlink feeds. Like Sushi’s Kashi, each pair is its own immutable and isolated market, which dramatically decreases cross-pool contagion risk. Borrowers provide collateral to pairs, and are able to take on debt up to a maximum Loan-to-Value amount set by the deployer (LTV). Borrowing assets from the pair carries interest, which is variable and based on the total utilization of lent assets in the pool. The base isolated lending mechanisms of Fraxlend are battle-tested, but have some unique features that should help attract users. For lenders, there are two primary concepts: fTokens and Vaults. Vaults are the core accounting mechanism for pairs, and track both the amount of assets in the pool, as well as the total outstanding claims to the pair. Each fToken represents a number of ‘shares’ equivalent to the value of deposited assets. The exchange rate of fTokens for pair assets is variable, and based on the amount of interest accrued to the vault since deposit. That means that current Share Price can be calculated at any time by dividing the Amount of Tokens in the Vault (read: Market Cap of the pair) by the outstanding total number of Shares (read: Total Value of Lent Assets). Borrowers have two major focus variables: LTV and Interest Rate. Each pool has a Maximum LTV of 75% for permissionless pairs that is immutable and set upon deployment. If the ratio of a borrower’s debt to their collateral rises above Maximum LTV, the position becomes unhealthy and can be liquidated. Liquidated positions are repaid on the borrower’s behalf in exchange for an equal value of collateral, plus a liquidation fee that is immutable on deployment, and set to 10% by default. As debt accrues interest over time, borrows can become unhealthy, meaning potentially active management of positions, through addition of collateral or repayment of debt, is important. Interest Rate determines the rate that borrowers pay to take debt against their collateral. This rate is set on a pair-by-pair basis, and is immutable and fixed upon deployment. Fraxlend will launch with two rate options: the Linear Rate Calculator and the Time-Weighted Variable Rate Calculator. The Linear Rate Calculator is the simpler of the two options, raising borrow interest rate linearly as pair utilization rises, and vice-versa. Source The Minimum Rate, Vertex Rate, and Max Rates are the three variables for Fraxlend pools set on launch. Minimum Rate is the base interest rate at 0% pool utilization. Between the Minimum Rate and the Vertex Rate, interest rate increases linearly. The increase in slope of the interest rate line between the Vertex Rate (75% utilization, for default permissionless pools) and the Max Rate (100% utilization) to help ensure rates adjust in periods of high demand for pool debt. The Time-Weighted Variable Rate Calculator allows the interest rate to float flexibly based on a target ‘healthy’ pool utilization rate and the amount of time that the pool has spent outside of the target range. More importantly, this method allows the market to determine equilibrium rate for a pool - if utilization is below the optimal range for a long enough period, rates will fall to make borrowing attractive once again; if utilization is too aggressive for too long, rates will rise and borrowers will naturally close positions to manage fees. Exploring over-collateralized lending is a critical avenue for Frax to realize its ethos and become the decentralized dollar of DeFi. While perhaps not as aggressive a structure as seen in other lending protocol structures, a siloed and over-collateralized model fits perfectly into the team's historic vision. The current process for permissionless lending is fraught with counterparty risk and unsustainable practices. As seen in the wake of meltdowns like 3AC, the majority of OTC deals occur on good faith and backroom Telegram chats. This creates systemic and centralized risk that is antithetical to crypto. Now, major counterparties can use Fraxlend based smart-contracts to simultaneously create lending markets for the largest institutions and the smallest retail investor, all built on the same FRAX rails. Not only does the organic balance sheet growth increase revenues for the platform, it also: Increases Decentralization FRAX Increases composability of FRAX Mitigates net negative rent-seeking behavior Needless to say, the deployment of Fraxlend is one of the most exciting and pivotal moments for the protocol since its launch.",https://flywheeloutput.com/p/fraxlend-becoming-a-bank

92,"Determining whether it sufficiently meets the necessary conditions for success Finding incremental opportunities for improvement of underlying technology Of the numerous underlying factors battling to regulate stablecoin price, there were two previously identified as especially important for protocol health- a flexible and agnostic collateralization ratio and sustainable yield economics. Thanks for reading Flywheel Output! Subscribe for free to receive new posts and support my work. This paper will focus on FRAX’s unique floating collateralization ratio (CR). Optimizing this technology remains the single most important factor for long-term protocol success; if the correct variables are chosen, even the most violent bank runs will be met by a fully redeemable backing. “For a partially-collateralized stablecoin to succeed, it must remain functionally over-collateralized through a combination of backing, trust, and revenue generation. Trust is earned, not created; at this point, given historical precedent and the nascent stage of the industry, assume value in trust to be approximately zero. Therefore, through a combination of trusted assets and revenue streams a partially-collateralized stablecoin could be both undercollateralized and pegged to $1.” - Bobby J. Shilla To create a stablecoin capable of surviving major bank runs during periods of low confidence it must always have sufficient collateral to ensure all liquid tokens are redeemable at 1:1. This should be achieved through collateral management, ensuring the maintenance of a balance sheet in equilibrium. Practically, we’ve seen three different major models evolve: Stablecoins that use volatile assets like ETH & BTC as backing (e.g. DAI). This requires efficient liquidity management, ensuring that capital is available to meet liquidation demands during spirals down. To provide breathing room from underlying volatility, these stablecoins must generally always remain overcollateralized, causing opportunity cost of capital to increase. Stablecoins that use other, less leveraged, stablecoin models as collateral (e.g. MIM using USDC). This creates leverage loops that can be difficult to untangle, and assess risk effectively. Stablecoins that use a combination of widely-trusted collateral and their governance token (e.g. FRAX, kind of LUNA). This method has been widely thrown out by the general DeFi populace as unsustainable, but I want to focus on this subcategory. While maligned, when structured properly such a model could use seigniorage generated by the governance token as an effective replacement for traditional backing. The final key component remains the ‘agnostic’ part of the collateralization ratio. That is, as market conditions and protocol revenue per dollar change, CR should adjust accordingly. This brings us back to the formula we proposed in the first piece to define the CR of a seigniorage-collateralized stablecoin: Collateralization Ratio Stablecoin = 1 - Protocol Profit Ratio Assets Deposited = CR*(Backing Asset) + 1-CR*(Seigniorage Token) The current FRAX structure ticks many (but perhaps not all) of the boxes for thorough risk management in high stress periods, which is likely a part of its recent resilience amid market turmoil. Let’s start by looking at the successful methods FRAX currently uses to manage peg and collateralization risk- an agnostic collateralization ratio and managing liquidity. Another key risk management technique is the use of a PIDController to control collateral ratio, as a factor of FXS, helping to avoid feedback loops (e.g. UST-LUNA spiral). Docs - Source Without re-inventing the technical wheel, the growth ratio is used to measure the spread between existing FRAX mints and current FXS circulation. For those who remember, a major concern leading into UST’s upheaval was the narrowing of the relative spread between the market cap of UST and LUNA. In the event of a mass bank run, a huge number of investors would simultaneously redeem FRAX for underlying assets. If collateralization ratio is set too low, the following feedback loop will occur: Investors redeem FRAX for stables and FXS Low CR leads to greater amount of FXS vs. stables Investors sell large quantities of FXS, driving price down Non-stable backing per FRAX falls Through use of the growth ratio, FRAX can automatically ensure that CR is rising in periods of high-stress, causing pressure on FXS to be minimized. Effectively, the greater the market cap of FXS is, relative to the market cap of FRAX, the lower the sell pressure. Currently, FRAX is primarily paired with the Curve 3pool which consists of USDC, USDT, and DAI and serves as the base pool in which all stablecoins are traded against. Recently, a Curve governance proposal passed that created a new meta-pool, FRAXBP, which consists of only FRAX and USDC. Stablecoins that pair to FRAXBP will be matched dollar for dollar with the Curve AMO. For example, if Abracadabra decides to supply $250 million worth of MIM to the pool Frax will inject $250 million worth of freshly minted FRAX and idle USDC collateral into FRAXBP. The ramifications of FRAXBP will be explored in future essays. FRAX’s current mechanisms are significantly more robust than competing algorithmic stablecoins. This relative resilience has been reflected in recent price action across the stablecoin space. However, one assumption is still currently being made around price during the minting process that could be improved to ensure backing. Specifically, as noted, FRAX uses a combination of FXS and trusted stables as backing. By taking FXS price as the underlying component of collateralization, FRAX is exposing itself to governance token volatility. In the event of a genuine black-swan event, FXS could be aggressively market sold (despite growth ratio safeguards) leaving FRAX undercollateralized. Armed with that information, they would have a live feed to set collateralization ratio. If the protocol is able to sustainably earn $0.10 on every $1 of FRAX minted through AMOs, and 100% of fee-generation is passed through to FXS holders, then the protocol could ostensibly use a portion of expected profit on minting activity to fund undercollateralized minting. This is only achievable through smart-contracts, which allow efficient pass-through of fees as well as a transparent verifiable account of such action. This change would allow the protocol to remain functionally over-collateralized, even in periods of high stress, and would also help create a true ‘fair-market’ value for FXS.

93,"In 1971, the US Dollar moved off the gold standard. Up until that point, each marginal dollar minted had to be backed by an equivalent amount in gold, which became increasingly unwieldy as the size of the economy had grown. This transition represented a shift from a ‘hard backing’ to a ‘soft backing’, where global demand for the dollar as a liquid asset helps it sustain its value against other currencies. This worth is derived from the fact that the dollar is backed by the full faith and credit of the American government. Practically, this means that USD is backed partially on ‘faith’, and partially by government revenue. This cashflow is what causes the dollar to gain and lose value, relative to other currencies, as trade and domestic industry cause demand volatility. In the digital asset space, there has been explosive growth in the use of stablecoins. These tokens are pegged to $1 USD, and facilitate liquidity and the translation of fiat into DeFi and the wider web3 ecosystem. However, because they are not issued by a government or Central Bank, they cannot rely on any external or pre-existing “faith or credit.” Instead, stablecoins have historically had to be fully collateralized, if not overcollateralized, ensuring that users can know with certainty their stablecoin is backed by real value. This allows institutions to issue stablecoins, generate revenue, and optimize their balance sheet, while still providing users assurance that they can redeem their stablecoins for assets with hard value in the event of a bank run. As an example, USDC is fully collateralized through cash, and cash equivalents. For every USDC minted, there is $1 of collateral in the treasury and USDC users can redeem 1 USDC for $1 at any time for any reason. On the other hand, DAI is overcollateralized via on-chain assets, such as ETH. Due to the fact that the assets backing DAI are volatile, they require a treasury in excess of backing to ensure redemption functionality in all market conditions. While this creates trust and user confidence, it hampers liquidity and capital efficiency. Collateralization ratio (CR - the ratio of outstanding stablecoins vs backing assets) flexibility is important. Without it, the system will be over-capitalising in periods of high revenue generation, and (more concerningly) under-capitalizing new issuance if revenue falls and CR remains untouched. Therefore, the first necessary condition for partially-collateralized stablecoin success is a collateralization ratio that flexes as protocol success and community trust ebbs-and-flows. Collateralization Ratio (Stablecoin) = 1 - Protocol Profit Ratio Assets Deposited = CR*(Backing Asset) + 1-CR*(Seigniorage Token) Where CR floats as protocol profit creates surplus value on the balance sheet, relative to total liabilities in the form of issued stablecoins. So, if the stablecoin was running a net profit on its balance sheet of 6%, they would be able to offer a CR of 94%. The backing token would be some other asset - likely a fully cash collateralized stablecoin (USDC), or, ideally, a CBDC. The second necessary condition is to maintain a source of protocol revenue generation that is: Sourced from organic demand Diversified Agnostic to the markets and protocols they are used in The second point is diversification of revenue. Crypto and DeFi are still very young and volatile industries. In order for a stablecoin to remain stable, it must be confident that it can continue market operations in ALL market conditions. As a result, the diversification of revenue streams and collateral backing are critical to long term success. Historically, a failure to diversify has led to the collapse of many partially-backed stablecoins when a 3rd party dependency undergoes stress or otherwise cuts cash flows. The instability inherent in under-collateralization must be shored up by diversification of use (and therefore revenue). Agnostic revenue means that the protocol should refuse to take on a fundamental view on markets or token price. All too often, the source of a stablecoin’s unwind occurs at the hands of an inherently misplaced price assumption. A protocol assuming a guarantee of its own stability as a necessary condition for functioning almost guarantees its failure. Therefore, ensuring that internal banking operations are price agnostic and designed to work efficiently under stress is crucial. So, the necessary conditions for automated stablecoin success are: Flexible Collateralization Ratio, that adjusts as protocol revenue and market sentiment shifts Revenue, driven by price-agnostic banking operations There have been a number of unsuccessful historical attempts to create automated stablecoins. Using the most notable examples, let’s investigate a selection of case studies, to verify our basic framework. For each, we will address the token mechanism through which peg was maintained, the macro outlook around collapse, and how the combination effectively guaranteed defeat in advance. In summary, the same mechanisms that made UST so attractive were its ultimate weak points. An effective collateral ratio of 0% meant it was very easy to mint new UST and grow the supply, but it also made it extremely easy to unwind. Both actions had a direct impact on the price of LUNA, and each action incentivized the next user to do the same action in the same direction. Thus, when times were good and inorganic incentives flowing, LUNA/UST skyrocketed and vice versa. Prior to UST, Iron Finance had an extremely popular algorithmic stablecoin, IRON, that accumulated ~$2bn in circulating supply. The stablecoin was supposed to remain pegged to $1 through a combination of locking 75% of each IRON’s value in collateralized USDC, and 25% into their native governance token, TITAN. Redemptions worked the opposite way, exchanging $1 of IRON for the equivalent value in USDC and TITAN. Like LUNA, this created a positive feedback loop during up-only markets, but collapses when sentiment on TITAN decreases. Prior iterations in the space have truly been ‘algorithmic’ rather than ‘automated’ stablecoins. Rather than use digital flexibility to adjust required collateral, they make fixed assumptions about unbacked asset prices that are axiomatic for the system to function. Mechanisms should remain agnostic about the success of the protocol, and as to which side of the trade they are taking. The primary goal in almost all cases should be to maximize profit generated through banking operations. Design of the protocol should be configurable such that, in the event of a bank run, collateralization ratio is able to go up to 100% backed by non-protocol assets. In future papers we will further develop the requirements for a partially collateralized stablecoin and seek to examine if FRAX meets them. These are not metrics sufficient to achieve success as a protocol or as a business, but instead are fundamental requirements for a functioning stablecoin.
